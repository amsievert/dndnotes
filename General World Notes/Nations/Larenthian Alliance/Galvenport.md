# Galvenport
**Population:** 51,260 (57% humans, 14% elves, 21% half-elves, 8% other races)

**Government:** Chief Magnate Thedric Alfir rules over the Larenthian Alliance from his throne here. He is known to be a slightly harsh but overall fair ruler. This city has a large amount of overseers, as well as apprentice overseers who train to be deployed to hamlets across the alliance. Chief Alfir consults with a council, known as the Mercantable, that consists of heads of industry from each major city in the alliance. These heads of industry reside mostly in Galvenport, so they have a tendency to be not very in-tune with the true needs of their represented people.

**Defense:** The capital city boasts a state of the art defensive system designed and built by the master inventors of [[Bippenbol]]. The outer wall of the city is roughly 25 feet tall and made of large blocks of stone. Each tower along the wall has a catapult loaded with black powder bombs. Within the city, the Constabulary keeps the peace among the citizenry. Constables can be identified by the Galvenport insignia, a gold coin overlaid on a simple ship, embossed into their breastplate. The Chief Magnate's employs his own noble guard.

**Commerce:** Nearly all goods are available in Galvenport, including illegal items. The underground market is sourced from a thriving smuggling empire on the sea. Contraband items include certain black powder devices, illegal magic items, and hallucinogenic substances.

**Organizations:** The Larenthian Trade Federation is headquartered in the city, and oversees all trade that happens in the Alliance. The Underguild runs the black market and all illegal activity in the city. The Divinaire Institute of [[Wizendell]] also has a campus in the city and holds some sway in trading and politics.

Capital City of the Alliance. It is a port town with goods from across the alliance as well as from other nations.

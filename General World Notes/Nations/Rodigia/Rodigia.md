# Rodigia
Capital City: Rhugnurt

The city of Rhugnurt is perched atop Mount Thogrin, the tallest mountain in Rodigia. The city is partially carved out of the top of the mountain, demonstrating the Giants' mastery of masonry. The city is guilt to be occupied by giants, so all of the buildings in it are giant-sized.

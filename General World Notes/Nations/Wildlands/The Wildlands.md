# The Wildlands
The Wildlands are the islands in the southwest of Chandaria. There is no overall governing body so there is no official capital city. The closest thing to one is the lawless pirate haven of Kraken Cove. This is on the north side of the large island, and it's rumored that the cove was hollowed out by a Kraken long ago. There still remain some Kraken worshippers in the city.

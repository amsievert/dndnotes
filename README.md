Welcome to my wiki for my Dugeons & Dragons world. The wiki can be found [here](http://wiki.alexsievert.com). This is something I've been working on for a while now. Ever since I started being a Dungeon Master about a year ago, I've wanted to build the most detailed world I possibly could. I started out taking notes on my world in Microsoft OneNote. Eventually I had so many notes that it was cumbersome to share the necessary information with players. I decided to make a wiki for my world, very much inspired by the Forgotten Realms wiki and the Critical Role Wiki. I doubt my world will ever be as detailed as those worlds, but maybe I'll get close some day.
Anyways, a little background on the wiki. I built it using Obsidian and a simple apache web server. Obsidian is a fantastic note taking tool that allows hyperlinking between pages, html-style editing, and a plethora of other cool features. I use a plugin on Obsidian that converts the markdown files to html files. Then I dump those files into this git repository and pull them to the web server to serve up hot and ready. I update the website usually once a week with everything I've done during that time.
Please feel free to take some time to explore the wiki and learn some fun facts about the world of Argena.

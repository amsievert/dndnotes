# An Overall History Of Chandaria
Chandaria has existed for as long as Argena, and is steeped in history, being the setting of many important historical events.

## Measuring Time
Time in Chandaria, and Argena as a whole, is measured in relation to the [Great Dissension](The%20Great%20Dissension), since it is by far the most influential historical event in the world's history. Years are either Pre-Dissension (PD) or Post-Scourge (PS). 0 years Pre-Dissension is marked by the Initial Incursion. 0 years Post-Scourge is marked by the signing of the Abdication Accords. Between these two events is the Great Dissension, in which Argena was irrevocably changed.

## Pre-Dissension Chandaria
Pre-Dissension Chandaria was a simplistically peaceful place. The humanoid races all lived in small city-states, each with a patron deity. Some deities, Genesis for example, were the patrons of multiple city-states.

The city-states all lived very independently of each other. Some communicated with each other but had no need to trade or travel at all. Pre-Dissension times are defined by heavy divine influence. Gods freely walked the material plane, and directly manipulated the world with their powers. They provided everything for their constituents, which generally kept the peace.

Beyond the reaches of these city-states roamed all manner of creatures. Most of the creatures survive to this day, but a few have became items of legend. The Great Serpents, demigods in their own right, held immense power over the material plane, but lost it during the Great Dissension.

## The Great Dissension
[[The Great Dissension]] irrevocably changed all of Argena. The conflict began as tensions between the Gods of the upper and lower planes grew to a head and lasted for 4 centuries. Nearly every race and creature was involved in the war in some way. Gods of both sides recruited mortals to fight on their side. Many modern religions can be traced back to these allegiances. 

The gods taught a select few humanoids to harness the weave and use magic through arcane practice. Eventually, these people realized the true power that the Gods were keeping to themselves. They recognized that they could potentially harness the weave and kill the Gods, ending the war that had displaced or killed so many of their friends and families. The original wizards of both sides formed a secret alliance, known as the Anteity League, and themselves became known as the Ancient Archmages, the first wizards.

The Ancient Archmages spent many years accumulating power and weapons. They were also secretly spreading knowledge of arcane practice across Argena, creating more wizards. Eventually, the Anteity League betrayed their leaders in the Battle for [[Caelum Insula]], also known as the Divine Betrayal. This marks the beginning of the Scourge.

The Scourge lasted for roughly 50 years. During it, the Anteity League decimated the Gods. At this point, there were three parties fighting. The forces of the upper and lower planes still fought against each other, which the Ancient Archmages capitalized on, killing multiple avatars of the Gods and even managing to kill [[Naivara]] herself (who was later resurrected during the Astral Devastation). 

The Scourge ended during the Battle of the Planes, where the Gods finally "defeated" the Ancient Archmages. Upon realizing they were about to truly die, the deities from both sides combined their power to banish all of the Ancients to the far corners of the multiverse.

After banishing the Ancient Archmages, the Gods drafted the Abdication Accords, agreeing to never walk the Material Plane again, in the hope of avoiding a conflict like the Scourge again. This ushered in an age known as the Chandari Dark Ages.

## The Chandari Dark Ages
The Chandari Dark Ages are a period of time just after the Scourge where most of the Pre-Dissension city-states were destroyed during the 450 years of fighting and nearly all of the followers of the Anteity League were killed by the Gods, losing most of their arcane knowledge. The knowledge did survive with the few remaining apprentices of the Ancients however, and would eventually make a comeback.

The Dark Ages were a time of rebuilding mostly. The relatively few survivors took to reestablishing and rebuilding the societies that had been lost to war. It was during this time that people that had once been separated by the old institutions now relied on each other to survive and reconstruct a new semblance of life. A period of unparalleled mixing of people and ideas began.

The Dark Ages ended in 189 PS, when the Ancient Blue Dragon Thalroth the Storm Wyrm took advantage of the Post-Dissension power vacuum and conjured a massive tempest that covered the entire continent for 2 weeks, forcing the Coalition of Free Peoples to surrender to him or else their kingdoms would be destroyed. This started the Age of Dragons.

## The Age of Dragons
The Age of Dragons was a period of around 300 years that started in 189 PS with Thalroth the Storm Wyrm subjugating the Coalition of Free Peoples. With Thalroth in power, other dragons began using their innate magical powers to terrorize cities and accumulate their own hoards. Thalroth was fine with this, as long as the dragons under him paid him a steep tribute.

Along with the dragons, other intelligent creatures began plundering and controlling parts of Chandaria as well. Fiends, aberrations, and even sentient beasts seized the opportunity for wealth. Thalroth allowed all of this, as long as tribute was paid. He realized that the humanoids were the only group powerful enough to usurp him, so by keeping them living in fear by allowing all types of different tyrants to decimate their civilization, he kept himself in power.

As his underlings came and went, Thalroth remained in power for nearly 300 years. Eventually, a group of heroes slayed him in 419 PS, ushering in a new era of humanoid prosperity.

# An Overall History Of Chandaria
Chandaria has existed for as long as Argena, and is steeped in history, being the setting of many important historical events.

## Measuring Time
Time in Chandaria, and Argena as a whole, is measured in relation to the [Great Dissension](The%20Great%20Dissension.md), since it is by far the most influential historical event in the world's history. Years are either Pre-Dissension (PD) or Post-Scourge (PS). 0 years Pre-Dissension is marked by the Initial Incursion. 0 years Post-Scourge is marked by the signing of the Abdication Accords. Between these two events is the Great Dissension, in which Argena was irrevocably changed.

## Pre-Dissension Chandaria
Pre-Dissension Chandaria was a simplistically peaceful place. The humanoid races all lived in small city-states, each with a patron deity. Some deities, Genesis for example, were the patrons of multiple city-states.

The city-states all lived very independently of each other. Some communicated with each other but had no need to trade or travel at all. Pre-Dissension times are defined by heavy divine influence. Gods freely walked the material plane, and directly manipulated the world with their powers. They provided everything for their constituents, which generally kept the peace.

Beyond the reaches of these city-states roamed all manner of creatures. Most of the creatures survive to this day, but a few have became items of legend. The Great Serpents, demigods in their own right, held immense power over the material plane, but lost it during the Great Dissension.

## The Great Dissension
[[The Great Dissension]] irrevocably changed all of Argena. The conflict began as tensions between the Gods of the upper and lower planes grew to a head and lasted for 4 centuries. Nearly every race and creature was involved in the war in some way. Gods of both sides recruited mortals to fight on their side. Many modern religions can be traced back to these allegiances. 

The gods taught a select few humanoids to harness the weave and use magic through arcane practice. Eventually, these people realized the true power that the Gods were keeping to themselves. They recognized that they could potentially harness the weave and kill the Gods, ending the war that had displaced or killed so many of their friends and families. The original wizards of both sides formed a secret alliance, known as the Anteity League, and themselves became known as the Ancient Archmages, the first wizards.

The Ancient Archmages spent many years accumulating power and weapons. They were also secretly spreading knowledge of arcane practice across Argena, creating more wizards. Eventually, the Anteity League betrayed their leaders in the Battle for [[Caelum Insula]], also known as the Divine Betrayal. This marks the beginning of the Scourge.

The Scourge lasted for roughly 50 years. During it, the Anteity League decimated the Gods. At this point, there were three parties fighting. The forces of the upper and lower planes still fought against each other, which the Ancient Archmages capitalized on, killing multiple avatars of the Gods and even managing to kill [[Naivara]] herself (who was later resurrected during the Astral Devastation). 

The Scourge ended during the Battle of the Planes, where the Gods finally "defeated" the Ancient Archmages. Upon realizing they were about to truly die, the deities from both sides combined their power to banish all of the Ancients to the far corners of the multiverse.

After banishing the Ancient Archmages, the Gods drafted the Abdication Accords, agreeing to never walk the Material Plane again, in the hope of avoiding a conflict like the Scourge again. This ushered in an age known as the Chandari Dark Ages.

## The Chandari Dark Ages
The Chandari Dark Ages are a period of time just after the Scourge where most of the Pre-Dissension city-states were destroyed during the 450 years of fighting and nearly all of the followers of the Anteity League were killed by the Gods, losing most of their arcane knowledge. The knowledge did survive with the few remaining apprentices of the Ancients however, and would eventually make a comeback.

The Dark Ages were a time of rebuilding mostly. The relatively few survivors took to reestablishing and rebuilding the societies that had been lost to war. It was during this time that people that had once been separated by the old institutions now relied on each other to survive and reconstruct a new semblance of life. A period of unparalleled mixing of people and ideas began.

The Dark Ages ended in 189 PS, when the Ancient Blue Dragon Thalroth the Storm Wyrm took advantage of the Post-Dissension power vacuum and conjured a massive tempest that covered the entire continent for 2 weeks, forcing the Coalition of Free Peoples to surrender to him or else their kingdoms would be destroyed. This event is known as the Rending of Skies, and it is what started the Age of Dragons.

## The Age of Dragons
The Age of Dragons was a period of around 300 years that started in 189 PS with Thalroth the Storm Wyrm subjugating the Coalition of Free Peoples. With Thalroth in power, other dragons began using their innate magical powers to terrorize cities and accumulate their own hoards. Thalroth was fine with this, as long as the dragons under him paid him a steep tribute.

Along with the dragons, other intelligent creatures began plundering and controlling parts of Chandaria as well. Fiends, aberrations, and even sentient beasts seized the opportunity for wealth. Thalroth allowed all of this, as long as tribute was paid. He realized that the humanoids were the only group powerful enough to usurp him, so by keeping them living in fear by allowing all types of different tyrants to decimate their civilization, he kept himself in power.

As his underlings came and went, Thalroth remained in power for nearly 300 years. Eventually, a group of heroes slayed him in 419 PS, ushering in a new era of humanoid prosperity.

## The Arcane Resurgence
The Arcane Resurgence immediately followed the Age of Dragons. With Thalroth defeated, the people of Chandaria promptly liberated themselves from those who once served him. With their newfound freedom, people once again had the time and power to pursue new ideas and technologies. Free from the oppression of the dragons, powerful mages from before the Age of Dragons took advantage of the focus on new ideas to spread a new ideology surrounding the use of magic.

They called it Kainomancy, or [[The Kainomantic Principles]]. It was developed as an antithesis to the Anteitic Principles. Rather than destruction and power, they instead focused on unity and ethics. Kainomancy preached about magic as a force that connects everything in the world. In an era of unmatched growth and innovation, the Kainomantic Principles spread rapidly. The ways of the Ancient Archmages, died out and magic thrived under a new ethos.

However, the Kainomantic Principles weren't perfect either. One thing that mages still struggled with was the balance between experimentation and ethics. In order to support the rapid innovation of magical practices, large parts of the world were devastated for resources. Mountains were leveled and dwarves were exploited in search of the newly discovered [[Harmonium]] crystals. During this time, most of the [[Westerwood]] was deforested for its Elderbark trees, which also were found to produce similar effects as Harmonium.

The Arcane Resurgence lasted for just over 500 years. It ended in 983 PS, when a massive army from the Astral Plane descended from the heavens and invaded the Material Plane. The war lasted for 11 years, and it irrevocably changed the world.

## The Astral Devastation
Scholars now know that the Astral Devastation began because Kainomancers began using the Elderbark trees to experiment with interplanar travel. However, they experimented too much, and weakened the Interplanar Fabric between the Material and Astral Planes. The mages didn't know it at the time, but beings on the other side took note of this infringement on their planar border.

One night in 983 PS, giant rifts opened in the night sky. Gith soldiers and astral aberrations poured out of the rifts. They set upon the major cities of Argena, so-called beacon cities, and sought to destroy most of human civilization in one massive attack. Many cities fell, but a few were able to fend off the first wave of attackers. Spellhaven was one such city that survived the initial attack. This invading force would soon come to be known as the Cosmic Imperium. Over the coming days, the inhabitants of Argena realized they would have to adjust to a new way of life, as after the initial attack, the sun did not rise the next morning, nor the next. The Cosmic Imperium had somehow halted the progress of the heavens and stuck Argena in a state of eternal night.

The Imperium set up bastions across Chandaria and all of Argena to cement their influence in the areas that they controlled. They destroyed any sort of mortal resistance that remained in the controlled territories and many nation leaders were forced to either submit to the invaders or cede most of their land and retreat to stronghold cities.

As the war progressed, the Kainomantic Principles began to crumble. Some mages began embracing the new psionic abilities that the Imperium was using. They became initiated in the psionic ways of the Cosmic Imperium. Other mages turned away from the Kainomantic Principles and reverted to using magic in forbidden Anteitic ways. Few true Kainomancers remained.

The beginning of the final resistance started when a group of mages from Spellhaven took up a seemingly impossible task. They set out to resurrect Naivara, the Goddess of the Moon. They thought that she would be able to end the eternal night and give the Material Plane inhabitants an advantage over the Imperium. They travelled to the edges of the Astral Plane where it was said that Naivara's soul remained. They performed a forbidden ritual to reconnect her soul with its body, and Naivara was reborn. She was grateful, and bestowed upon them the Aegis of the Veil, a relic with the power to seal the rifts in the Interplanar Fabric. Unfortunately for the mages, that was the most she could do to thank them, without further breaking the abdication accords.

The Aegis became more than just a tool. The mages used the Aegis as a symbol to rally the remaining mortal resistance. That same group travelled around Argena gathering local resistances and sealing the minor rifts around the world. The resistance suffered great losses, but they managed to seal all of the rifts on Argena except for one.

The Battle of Limmedorrn's Rift was the climax of the Astral Devastation. It took place in the sky near where modern-day Sella Alora is. This rift was the largest that the Cosmic Imperium had created and was the main supply line into the Material Plane. The united forces of the mortal resistance first assaulted the bastion that had been built below the rift. Once they had control of the ground, they launched their attack into the sky to the actual rift. Wielding the Aegis of the Veil, a mage by the name of Ilothar Ilbrie, one of the original mages from Spellhaven who resurrected Naivara, fought through the Imperium's forces and managed to complete the sealing ritual, closing the rift for good, but dying in the process. The remaining Imperium soldiers fought for a while, but eventual the survivors either surrendered or fled, hiding in small groups across Argena.

## The Age of Dominion
In the aftermath of the Astral Devastation, mortal spirits were high. One of the generals of the mortal army at the Battle of Limmedorrn's Rift, named Godrick Lansen began making himself very known across Chandaria. He travelled around to the beacon cities, riling up the survivors and invoking the martyrdom of Ilothar Ilbrie. Godrick preached the need for mortals to expand their influence by travelling to other planes and colonizing them. This platform would have seemed radical in most contexts, but following the Astral Devastation and the victory over the Cosmic Imperium, people bought into it, and Godrick gained a sizable following.

Godrick used his influence in Spellhaven to start the construction of the Planar Nexus. This device was the pinnacle of all of the arcane knowledge gained over the course of the Arcane Resurgence and the Astral Devastation. It allowed large groups of people to travel to any plane of existence that they wanted.

Using the Nexus, Chandarian forces spread across the multiverse. They began conquering large regions on many other planes. The forces of the other planes were caught by surprise and fell to the Chandarian conquerors. The colonizers set up outposts in the conquered regions.

For the next 400 years, Chandarian influence spread across the planes, but it was not without challenge. Starting around 1300 PS, internal and external resistance pushed against Chandarian influence. Chandarian forces on the elemental plane of air were defeated and control of the plane of air was lost.

This defeat made some Chandarians realize that they were no different than the Cosmic Imperium of a past age. Revolutionaries from Chandaria secretly met with conquered people from other planes. They began planning an attack that would end this era of colonialism.

In 1423 PS, a small guerilla force composed of Chandarians and extraplanar revolutionaries attacked the Planar Nexus in Spellhaven. With a highly coordinated attack, the group gained access to the Nexus and destroyed it. With a massive explosion, the Planar Nexus was sundered, and the continent's connection to the other planes was severed.

Left to fend for themselves, the Chandarian outposts on the other planes succumbed to local uprisings or were assimilated into the planes themselves. Meanwhile on the Material Plane, Chandaria's economy collapsed. Having become reliant on exotic resources from other planes, the whole continent fell into disarray. The empire that had been established through the interplanar colonization began falling apart. Political alliances crumbled and many cities and regions fell into isolationism.

## The Era of Reconciliation
For roughly the next century, the fractured independent states were left on their own to heal from the Sundering of the Nexus and the end of the Age of Dominion. The expansionist ideologies of the previous age quickly lost traction and new philosophies of peace and cooperation spread.

The Era of Reconciliation was a period of discovery for many. People had time to think about the institutions of the past and their cyclical failures. There was a complete cultural reset across Chandaria.

Some independent city-states began forming alliances again based on trade and mutual defense. The most notable was the growing Larenthian Alliance, ran by Lawrence Galaven. The Alliance was officially founded in 1508 PS, which is widely considered to be the official end of the Era of Reconciliation and the start of the Age of Peace.

## The Age of Peace
Learning from the past failures of the world, Chandaria entered into what is known as the Age of Peace. This Age of Peace is the current age of the world. No notable global-scale incursions have happened since 1500 PS that would mark the start of a new age.

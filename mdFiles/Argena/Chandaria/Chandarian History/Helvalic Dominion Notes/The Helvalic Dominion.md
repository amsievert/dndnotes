# The Helvalic Dominion
The Helvalic Dominion occupied the land of Holfirth before the Larenthian Alliance took over in 1508 PS. The Helvalic people devoutly worshipped [[Valos]]. They built the Solar Nexus south of the Eldermere Lake to try to communicate with [[Valos]] and travel to Arborea. The Helvalic Dominion came to an end due to increasing pressure from the rising Larenthian Alliance invading from the east.

# Ith Alora
At the base of Mount Tayeche, the Westerwood was more of a jungle, and nestled inside the dense jungle was the elven city of Ith Alora. The elves that built the city didn't want to bother the natural beauty of the jungle, so half of the city was built among the treetops of the large jungle trees. At the time it was built, the city was an architectural marvel. Due to the lack of connections between the city-states, the building techniques didn't spread.

The modern capital city of Sella Alora is built over the ruins of the ground buildings of Ith Alora, which survived because of their superior construction.

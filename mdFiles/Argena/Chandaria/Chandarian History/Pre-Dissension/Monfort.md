# Monfort
Situated on the slopes of Mount Tayeche (which is now known as the Exalted Summit), Monfort was one of the larger cities of the Pre-dissension time. It had no patron deity, instead relying on heavy fortifications and an extremely defensible position on the side of the mountain to keep it safe.

Due to it's lack of divine influence, Monfort actually survived the Great Dissension and stood as a bastion of civilization in the decades following the Scourge. However, the city was not safe from Anteitic ideologies, and it was a safehaven for early practitioners of the arcane arts.

 Monfort was destroyed by Kainomancers during the Arcane Resurgence. Following the Scourge, the city remained as a stronghold for Anteitic mages. The mages of the city cloaked it with illusion magic during the Age of Dragons, keeping it from being discovered by the draconic overlords.

Following the fall of Thalroth and the start of the Arcane Resurgence, the mages ended the Illusory magic and opened the gates of Monfort once again to outsiders. The city became a great exporter of Anteitic ideology, spreading the philosophies across Chandaria. The newly coined Kainomancers quickly learned of this Anteitic stronghold and began planning to destroy it. 

In 512 PS, a group of elite Kainomancers attacked Monfort and completely destroyed it.

# Pylaxes
A great Elven hero from the Pre-Dissension era, Pylaxes secured his immortal legacy in through his union with Tiamat. 
## Adventures
Pylaxes was one of the most well-traveled mortals of the Pre-Dissension era. He originally hailed from the Elvish city-state of Osmirith in the western forests of Chandaria, known as the Westerwood. However, he was never satisfied with accepting life as it was, and he took to wandering as soon as he learned to wield a sword and ride a horse.
Initially, he explored just to see what was out in the world. Much of the continent was still completely unexplored, and he sought to expand his city's knowledge of the world. In his years of adventuring, he doubled Osmirith's claimed land, and even founded his own city-state known as Pylos.

#### The Highland Chimera
North of Osmirith in the mountains near the present-day Exalted Summit, Pylaxes learned of a chimera that was terrorizing many of the peaceful woodland beings in the area. Armed with nothing but a shortsword, wooden shield, and chain shirt, Pylaxes climbed for four days up to the chimera's cave in the peaks. Showing great cunning, he snuck into the cave while the chimera was out hunting, and waited until it returned, then ambushed it in its sleep.
Pylaxes gained great favor with the neighboring forest creatures for slaying the chimera, and they helped him out on his future adventures. They blessed him with great knowledge of the surrounding area as well.

#### The Eklek Invasion
While establishing Pylos, Pylaxes and the initial settlers were struggling with an army of trolls that was invading from the south. These trolls were a prominent tribe known as the Ekleks, led by a mutated troll called Skug. They hailed from the coastal cliffs to the south. They had begun a campaign into the Westerwood, destroying the forest as they went.
Pylaxes sought to put an end to the Eklek's invasion of his new territory, so he devised a plan. Being heavily outnumbered and underpowered, he needed to be extremely cunning. Knowing the trolls' affinity for rotting corpses, Pylaxes gathered up all of the bodies from the most recent battle and piled them at the bottom of a hill. When the trolls came to feast, Skug insisted that he eat first. As soon as Skug approached the pile, Pylaxes lit a huge wooden ball covered in oil and pushed it down the hill. The flaming ball crashed through the ranks of trolls, killing many instantly, including Skug. The rest retreated and were never seen again.

#### Tienralt of the Bay
Pylaxes's greatest adventure was his battle with the Ancient Blue Dragon Tienralt. Tienralt was the last thing holding back Pylos from becoming the most prosperous city-state in the whole region. Tienralt constantly collected tithes from Pylos and Osmirith, so Pylaxes decided to put an end to it.
He gathered a party of the best adventurers he had met throughout his travels and set out towards Tienralt's Lair.
This time, Pylaxes didn't use any tricks. His party fought Tienralt head-on. They took heavy losses, losing three of the five members during the fight. This angered Pylaxes, who climbed the wing of the dragon and jumped from the top, driving his sword straight through the base of the dragons skull, killing it.

## Tiamat's Revenge
When Tiamat learned of the death of Tienralt, she was outraged, and went to investigate the region. She tracked Pylaxes back to Pylos and confronted him. In his last great heroic action, Pylaxes was somehow able to seduce Tiamat, and she left Pylos alone.
Despite Tiamat being bound to Gruumsh, she and Pylaxes had four children, who became [[The Great Serpents]].

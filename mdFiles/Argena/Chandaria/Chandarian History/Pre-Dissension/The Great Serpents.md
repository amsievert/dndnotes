# The Great Serpents
There were four Great Serpents that roamed the material plane during the [Pre-Dissension](Pre-Dissension%20Chandaria) era. They were all children of [[Tiamat]] and the mortal hero [[Pylaxes]]. The Serpents were all bastard children, as [[Tiamat]] was still bonded to [[Gruumsh]] when she had the children with [[Pylaxes]]. [[Gruumsh]] despised these wedlock children so he cursed them. The Serpents, who initially resembled dragons, were stripped of their wings and appendages, turning them into essentially massive snakes. The Serpents then had children amongst themselves known as the Serpentkin. The Great Serpents and their children fought alongside [[Tiamat]] during the [Great Dissension](The%20Great%20Dissension.md).

### The Sky Serpent
Himmelslang was known as the Sky Serpent. He was the favorite serpent of [[Tiamat]], so she tried everything in her power to reverse the curse. Himmelslang ended up having a set of dragon wings grafted onto him and with this, he became the sky serpent.
Himmelslang was said to encircle the entire sky, protecting Argena from extraplanar threats. His main battles were usually against invaders from the Astral Plane. Himmelslang's greatest battle was with an Elder Brain that was attempting to expand its empire into the material plane.

### The Water Serpent
Haval is the Water Serpent. When she was cursed, she exiled herself to the Azure Expanse, taking to life beneath the waves, a place where most dragons stay far away from. She spent centuries swimming through the great blue depths of the Azure Expanse, emerging very rarely, and adapting to a life without air.
Some Post-Scourge sailors claim to see Haval sometimes in the depths of the ocean. While these are simply tall tales, many of these sailors swear by their accounts.

### The Twin Serpents
Jordun and Svibrann were the other two of the great serpents. They were born twins and were constantly competing with each other. Jordun claimed [[Chandaria]] do be his, while Svibrann claimed Enulon for herself. Some of the mountain ranges on these continents are rumored to be areas where these Serpents broke through the ground. At the same time, volcanoes are also said to be spots where the Serpents burst out, leaving behind fiery aftermath.
Svibrann always made fun of Jordun for how much bigger her continent was than his. Jordun became self-conscious about [[Chandaria]] and tried his best to make it as luxurious of a place as possible. He was constantly keeping the Serpentkin and other ambitious creatures in check. Because of this, he was called The Equalizer by some.

### Guardians of the Inner Planes
The Great Serpents and the Serpentkin fought alongside [[Tiamat]] in the [Great Dissension](The%20Great%20Dissnesion). After the Scourge, it was decided that they would be sent to the Elemental Planes. Himmelslang was sent to the Plane of Air, Haval to the Plane of Water, Jordun to the Plane of Earth, and Svibrann to the Plane of Fire.
Over time, the Serpents each developed abilities that fit with their respective planes. Svibrann regained her draconic fire breath, Haval because the quickest swimmer on the Plane of Water, and Himmelslang grew his own wings and became better at flying.
Upon their assignment to the Elemental Planes, the Great Serpents were also given the tasks of protecting the Inner Planes by maintaining the border between the Elemental Planes and the Outer Planes. The Serpents became masters of the Elemental Chaos, able to traverse it with ease, patrolling for vagrants from the Outer Planes.

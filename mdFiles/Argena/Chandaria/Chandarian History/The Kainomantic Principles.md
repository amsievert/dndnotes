# The Kainomantic Principles of Magic
Kainomancy is an ideology developed during the early days of the Arcane Resurgence. It was created as a direct opposition to the Anteitic Principles. Instead of the destruction and power of the Anteitic Principles, Kainomancy focuses on unity and ethics instead. The Kainomantic Principles are as follows:
## 
### 1. Magic as Harmony
For the new generation of mages, magic was not a tool for dominion, but rather a force to bring balance between individuals, societies, and nature. The shifting of the main goal of magic is instrumental in the difference between the Kainomantic and Anteitic Principles. It served as the basis for the other new ideas of Kainomancy.

### 2. The Collective as Supreme
While the Ancient Archmages tried to spread the power of magic to all mortals, their archaic beliefs led them to inadvertently creating an elitist class system based on magical prowess. The Kainomantic Principles attempted to fix this by shifting the concept of magic to a shared resource that everyone interacts with in some form, regardless of their intellectual ability.

### 3. Creation as Restoration
To the new mages, one of the biggest failings of the Anteitic Principles was the infatuation with the complete destructions of old systems. They correctly deduced that this was the reason for the most destructive actions of the Ancient Archmages. In an attempt to acknowledge the original reason for the focus on destruction while still remaining constructive, they shifted to the idea that magic is a means to repair the damage of the past, rather than to completely uproot. This was mostly manifested through a focus on innovation in arcane technologies and research.

### 4. Magic as Connection
As a reinforcement of the overall theme of Kainomancy, the last principle is simply that magic is a bridge between mortals, the world, the divine, and each other. The strength of this idea came from the fact that it has a basis in reality. It was known at the time that The Weave was merely an interface to connect with the raw magical power that suffuses the universe. This raw magic is said to be a part of the goddess Harmonia herself. So in that sense magic really is a force of connection between all these different entities.

## The Effects of Kainomancy
The Kainomantic Principles had a profound effect on many people's views of the arcane. Casters and non-casters alike were swept up in a newfound sense of unity. People were drawn to the positivity of Kainomancy, and it quickly became the dominant ideology, and the Anteitic principles were mostly extinguished.

The effects of Kainomancy were not all positive though. One thing to note about the Kainomantic Principles is that they say nothing in opposition of the "Unfettered Experimentation" pillar of the Anteitic Principles. Consequently, the Arcane Resurgence saw rampant innovation at the cost of the natural world. Mountains were leveled in search of the newly discovered Harmonium, and the [[Westerwood]] was heavily deforested for its Elderbark trees.

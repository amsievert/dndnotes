 ames are a popular pastime for all manner of folk across [[Chandaria]]. Games are played in taverns, castle keeps, and hovels alike throughout the land. The popularity of games has also led to the rise of gambling. Gambling often happens in taverns, but it can also happen in more private areas too. Gambling however, is not legal across all of [[Chandaria]], with areas such as [[Luminespore Hollow]] in the [Larenthian Alliance](The%20Larenthian%20Alliance.md), and [[Marrisburg]] in [Falstor](Falstor%20(Kingdom).md) outlawing gambling.
## Common Games
Common games across [[Chandaria]] include [[#Fiendish Fortune]], [[#3 Die Divination]], and [[#Scurvy Knave]].
### Fiendish Fortune
Fiendish Fortune is a card game that originated among the dwarves in the mines of [[Essaheim]]. When playing the game, those who were very good at it were said to have struck a deal with a devil to have luck that rivalled that of [[Lucite]].
Fiendish Fortune involves both players placing down an equal ante. Once the antes are placed, each player draws three cards. This is simulated by the player rolling 3d6. The ranking of hands is as follows:
1. Three of a kind (Highest)
2. Straight
3. Flush (All even or all odd)
4. Pair
5. High Card (Lowest)
The player can place into the pot an additional amount of money equal to their ante to redraw (reroll) one card. The player with the higher hand wins all the money in the pot.
### 3 Die Divination
This game originated in the halls of the Grand Halls of [Spellhaven](Valdens.md). It actually originated as an exercise in the Divination schools to teach students how to do simple prediction. Students then took the game and began spreading it on the streets in cities across [[Chandaria]], introducing the gambling aspect of the game.
The player bets any amount, chooses a number between 1 and 6. The dealer then rolls 3d6. If one die matches the player's number, they get their money back plus an equal amount. If two dice match the player's number, they get their money back plus double the amount. If three dice match the player's number, they get their money back plus triple the amount. And if none of the dice match, the dealer keeps the player's money.
### Scurvy Knave
Scurvy Knave isn't as popular as the other two games, and is usually only played in gambling houses and casinos. It comes from the royal courts of [[No'zaral]]. The term "Scurvy Knave" referred to the flamboyant jesters who would challenge people in this game and take all of their money.
Scurvy Knave is a card game played with a 52 card deck. It involves a dealer and between 1 and 4 players. The game is played exactly like real-life [Blackjack](https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/how-to-play-blackjack/). 

## Sports
### Bloodball
Bloodball is similar to handball but with extreme violence. The game can be played with any number of players on a team, but they must be equal numbers. In terms of violence there are only two things not allowed: killing a player, and interacting with the goalie. The goalie is the only protected player.

When holding the ball, the ball carrier has two options. They can run with the ball, or throw it to a teammate. However, there is a semicircle zone around each team's goal that it is forbidden to step inside of.

A team scores by throwing the ball past the goalie and into the goal, which scores 1 point. The game is usually played to 5 points.
#### Mechanics
The game utilizes reactions a lot.
##### Running
A player carrying the ball can move with their movement speed while carrying the ball. If at any point they enter a square adjacent to a defender, that defender can use their reaction to attempt to steal the ball by initiating a contested athletics/acrobatics roll.
##### Passing
As an action, the ball carrier can attempt to pass the ball by making a ranged attack roll with the ball (the ball is a 30/90 ranged weapon). The ranged attack just needs to beat the target's AC, which motivates players to not wear armor.

A defender that is within 5 feet of the pass trajectory can use their reaction to attempt to intercept the ball. This is an Athletics/Acrobatics check where the DC is the attack roll of the pass.

If there is a defender within 5 feet of the player attempting the catch the ball, they can use their reaction to force the catching player to make a contested athletics/acrobatics check. If the defender wins the contest, the ball is knocking loose and lands on the ground.
##### Loose Ball
Picking up the ball from the ground requires a player to use their action to pick it up.
##### Shooting
The player with the ball can attempt to throw it into the goal. To do so they make a ranged attack roll. This roll is contested by the goalie making an acrobatics check. If the attack roll beats the goalie's acrobatics check, the ball goes in. If the goalie beats the attack roll by more than 5, they catch it. If not, the ball rebounds back into play at a random point around the goal arc. If a goalie is forced to make multiple saves in a turn, all subsequent rolls after the first are done with disadvantage.

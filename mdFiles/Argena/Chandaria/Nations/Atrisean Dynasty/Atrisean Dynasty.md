## Government
The Atrisean Dynasty is an autocratic state ruled by the God King. The God King is chosen from a believed divine bloodline, currently the Teinithra line. God King Olym Teinithra currently rules the nation with absolute power. The God King holds no other cabinet or council members, as it is expected that all of his decisions are made with divine insight.

The current Teinithra bloodline claims to be descended from [[Lucite]], which they use to justify their extensive commandeering of valuables from the denizens of the Dynasty. Some of these valuables are used to decorate the capital city of [[Sella Alora]], known as the city of gold. The God King rules from the [[Sella Alora|Divine Spire]], the tallest building in [[Sella Alora]], built on the side of the [[Exalted Summit]].

## History
The Atrisean Dynasty was founded in 1612 PS by [[Atrizar]], a powerful demigod with a host of accomplishments across the planes. After retiring from adventuring, she settled at the base of [[Exalted Summit|Mount Tayeche]] in the ruins of [[Ith Alora]]. She began rebuilding the ancient elven city and people soon began moving in, still looking for a permanent home following the end of the [[An Overall History Of Chandaria#The Age of Dominion|Age of Dominion]] and the [[An Overall History Of Chandaria#The Era of Reconciliation|Era of Reconciliation]]. Atrizar ruled for a little over 40 years, before she was banished from the Material Plane by [[Gruumsh]]. The sudden loss of a great leader caused a huge power vacuum, that eventually led to the Dewsong family claiming control of the growing nation by asserting that they were descendants of [[Eurus]].

# Overview
Sampi is a small village northwest of [[Sangara]] in the [[Atrisean Dynasty]]. It is almost exclusively inhabited by Lizardfolk, whose cold-blooded bodies enjoy the thick, swampy heat of this area. The population is small, no more than a few hundred, but it is rich in history and natural significance.

The village is very secluded from the rest of the world beyond the swamp. Many of the Lizardfolk inhabitants know nothing of the rest of [[Chandaria]]. The little that they do know comes mostly from missionaries that come from Sella Alora on behalf of the God King. These missionaries never stay for long however, as the Lizardfolk are a stubborn people and always prove incredibly devout to their ancient beliefs.
## Population
Sampi has a population of around 320 people, with over 95% of them being Lizardfolk. To many, the people of Sampi would appear to be incredibly poor, living in mud huts in the swamp. However, the inhabitants themselves are quite pleased with their little village, since the architecture and organization is specifically tailored to their needs as a species.

The people of Sampi get along very well, as there is no real class structure or other means of social segregation. The only group that is slightly elevated are the Elders, who are simply the oldest and wisest members of the population. They are revered because they are seen to be closer to the Beastlands because they are closer to dying. This gives them somewhat of an inherent divinity.
## Government
The population of Sampi entrust the governing of the village to the Elders, of which there are currently 10 considered to be old enough. The duties of an Elder are to manage supplies of food, delegate the construction of new buildings, and remedy any other complaints brought forth by other members of the village.

The death of an Elder is considered to be a cause for great celebration, because it marks the end of their journey in the mortal world and begins their existence in the eternity of the Beastlands.
# Culture
Sampi's culture can seem uncivilized to the uninitiated, but it is actually quite deep. It just requires a very esoteric knowledge of the traditions of the Lizardfolk.

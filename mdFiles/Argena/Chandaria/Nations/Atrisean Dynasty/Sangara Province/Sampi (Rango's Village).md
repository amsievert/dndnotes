# Overview
Sampi is a small village northwest of [[Sangara]] in the [[Atrisean Dynasty]]. It is almost exclusively inhabited by Lizardfolk, whose cold-blooded bodies enjoy the thick, swampy heat of this area. The population is small, no more than a few hundred, but it is rich in history and natural significance.

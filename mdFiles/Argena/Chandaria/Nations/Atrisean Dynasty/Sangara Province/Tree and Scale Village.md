# Overview
Tree and Scale (Skjalkagh'ternockshripomn in draconic) is a small village northwest of [[Sangara]] in the [[Atrisean Dynasty]]. It is almost exclusively inhabited by Lizardfolk, whose cold-blooded bodies enjoy the thick, swampy heat of this area. The population is small, no more than a few hundred, but it is rich in history and natural significance.

The village is very secluded from the rest of the world beyond the swamp. Many of the Lizardfolk inhabitants know nothing of the rest of [[Chandaria]]. The little that they do know comes mostly from missionaries that come from Sella Alora on behalf of the God King. These missionaries never stay for long however, as the Lizardfolk are a stubborn people and always prove incredibly devout to their ancient beliefs.
## Population
Tree and Scale has a population of around 320 people, with over 95% of them being Lizardfolk. To many, the people of Tree and Scale would appear to be incredibly poor, living in mud huts in the swamp. However, the inhabitants themselves are quite pleased with their little village, since the architecture and organization is specifically tailored to their needs as a species.

The people of Tree and Scale get along very well, as there is no real class structure or other means of social segregation. The only group that is slightly elevated are the Elders, who are simply the oldest and wisest members of the population. They are revered because they are seen to be closer to the Beastlands because they are closer to dying. This gives them somewhat of an inherent divinity.
## Government
The population of Tree and Scale entrust the governing of the village to the Elders, of which there are currently 10 considered to be old enough. The duties of an Elder are to manage supplies of food, delegate the construction of new buildings, and remedy any other complaints brought forth by other members of the village.

The death of an Elder is considered to be a cause for great celebration, because it marks the end of their journey in the mortal world and begins their existence in the eternity of the Beastlands.
# Culture
Tree and Scale's culture can seem uncivilized to the uninitiated, but it is actually quite deep. It just requires a very esoteric knowledge of the traditions of the Lizardfolk.
## Architecture
Geographically, Tree and Scale is built in a region where the dense Atrisean jungle becomes even more humid and swampy as it nears the coast. Due to this climate, Tree and Scale consists mostly of small houses made with mud and other dried vegetation. Another popular building among the village are the Vutos (Saunas, roughly translates to Sun Room in common). These mud structures are built to channel the high equatorial sun into water tubs that evaporate and heat the Vuto with steam. These are a necessity to help the Lizardfolk regulate their body temperatures.

In the center of the village is the Shallosh, a large ziggurat built near the Elderbark trees at the center of the village. The Shallosh acts as a temple to the lizard gods. It provides an excellent view of the Elderbarks while praying.

All of the buildings of Tree and Scale are spread across a swampy marsh, and are connected by a network of waterways, as opposed to streets. While there are rafts and floats used by the few non-lizardfolk inhabitants of Tree and Scale to navigate the village, most of the populace simply prefers to swim wherever they need to go.
## Religion
The Lizardfolk of Tree and Sscale pray to their own gods, who are not part of the [[Gods and Mythos (Aeonic Pantheon)|Aeonic Pantheon]]. They recognize four gods, each with their own divine domain:
1. Vu - The Goddess of the Sun
2. Sjo - The God of the Earth
3. Eeso- The God of the Sky
4. Haal - The Goddess of the Water

The Lizardfolk people believe that these four deities created the world as it is, and have protected it from evil for many years. They also believe that these deities live in the Beastlands, where they rule over a land free of evil and full of wilderness. Dying and going to live alongside the Gods in the Beastlands is the greatest honor and aspiration of a Lizardfolk.

The last surviving remnants of the Lizardfolk Gods in the mortal world are said to be the Elderbark trees that sit at the center of Tree and Scale. It is believed that these trees, one large Mother tree and many smaller child trees, were left behind by the Gods when they departed for the Beastlands, and serve as a means of monitoring their children as well as a way for the Lizardfolk to communicate spiritually with the Gods.
## Social Organization
There are many different jobs in Lizardfolk society. Each is aptly named in a very direct way, as is custom with many other facets of Lizardfolk culture. A few common jobs are:
- Hatchwarden: Protector of the egg hatcheries in the village.
- Broodmother: One who helps those with many hatchlings. A babysitter of sorts.
- Huntmaster: A leader of hunting parties.
- Cooker: A specialist in preparing meals.
- Sunsitter: A derogatory word to describe someone who is lazy or unemployed.
## History
The history of Tree and Scale and the Lizardfolk people is told entirely through the oral traditions. Lizardfolk love telling stories, through song, story, or even dance sometimes (although the dances often look more like fighting than anything else).
### Creation Myth
The story goes that the entire world was created by many Gods, not just the four Lizardfolk Gods. They all collaborated together to build a world teeming with life. The Lizardfolk Gods created the swamp and the jungle to appeal best to the likes of their children, the original Lizardfolk. They had their own little section of paradise in the mortal world.

The other Gods that created other parts of the world were foolish deities. They grew to hate each other and their creations, and they had a huge fight. These other Gods all killed each other in the fighting, but the Lizardfolk Gods didn't join this frivolous fight, and instead protected their children from the devastation. Following the fight, the Lizardfolk Gods decided it would be best to return to their home, a land inconceivably far from the jungle. This fabled land came to be known as the Beastlands, and is said to be where dead Lizardfolk go to reunite with their kin and creators.
### Village History
Tree and Scale itself traces its history back a few hundred years. It was supposedly founded when a few families decided to band together to protect each other against a group of "Big Ones" (monsters) that were terrorizing the area. They eventually killed the monsters and attracted more nearby Lizardfolk to their settlement, who assimilated into what would soon become the village of Tree and Scale. These first families are known as "The Great Hunters", since they hunted and killed the "Big Ones", a task that has inspired a tradition among the Lizardfolk of hunting great beasts and reveling in the glory of the hunt.

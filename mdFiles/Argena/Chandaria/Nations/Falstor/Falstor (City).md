# Overview
The city of Falstor sits atop Reudan's Prominence, a low, flat hill that gives the city a panoramic view of the northern coastline of the Kingdom of Falstor. On the southeast side of the city, at the bottom of the hill is the city of Dalonstor, often referred to as Falstor's sister city. The two are connected by a massive polished-stone staircase called the King's Steps.

Falstor is the capital city of the Kingdom of Falstor. The city is the home of the ruling king, as well as the richest families in the Kingdom. These families, the [[Falstor (City)#The Royal Houses of Falstor|Royal Houses of Falstor]], are all owners of different industries across the Kingdom. Each of them have manors in the city, as well as large estates elsewhere in the Kingdom.
## Population
The city of Falstor has a population of around 84,250 people (55% Humans, 29% Half-Elves, 11% Elves, 5% Other). The general population of the city would be considered upper class when compared to the other cities of Falstor. Those that are not a part of the Royal Houses, are still rich merchants and artisans, or come from old money.
## Government
As the capital city of the Kingdom, Falstor is run by the King and the King's Council, which is made up of other members from the King's House. The King himself, who becomes the patriarch of his own house upon coronation, holds the final say in all court decisions. He is not obligated to listen to his council, but Kings often do because to not would put many blades at their back from their own family.
## Defenses
Alongside being atop Reudan's Prominence, Falstor also has a large stone wall that surrounds the entire city. These two features make the city very defensible from direct assault. However, the city is vulnerable to a prolonged siege, since it relies heavily on fish from Dalonstor for food.

Across the kingdom, including in the capital city itself, the Kingsguard keep peace among the King's constituents. The Kingsguard are separate from the Kingdom's standing military, although many members of the Guard are often veterans or young people trying to get experience before joining the military.
# Organizations
For those that are aware of it, Falstor can feel like it is always on a knife's edge, teetering above total collapse. There are so many organizations, not just the Royal Houses, that are constantly vying for control of the Kingdom from the shadows.
## The Royal Houses of Falstor
The Royal Houses are called so because all of them in the past have held a legitimate claim to the Falstor throne. There are five of them, each drawing massive wealth from owning industry across the Kingdom. All five have at one point either held the crown or had a family member with a confirmed claim for the crown.

## Lawbringers of the Herald of Light
Priests of [[Pholtus]], the Lawbringers hold significant power in the royal court. Their main duty to the throne is to verify and uphold the sanctity of the crown. Without the blessing of Pholtus, Herald of Light, a King's rule is not considered legitimate. It is very important to have the Lawbringers on your side as a King.

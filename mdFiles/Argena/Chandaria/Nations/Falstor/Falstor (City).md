# Overview
The city of Falstor sits atop Reudan's Prominence, a low, flat hill that gives the city a panoramic view of the northern coastline of the Kingdom of Falstor. On the southeast side of the city, at the bottom of the hill is the city of Dalonstor, often referred to as Falstor's sister city. The two are connected by a massive polished-stone staircase called the King's Steps.

Falstor is the capital city of the Kingdom of Falstor. The city is the home of the ruling king, as well as the richest families in the Kingdom. These families, the Royal Houses of Falstor, are all owners of different industries across the Kingdom. Each of them have manors in the city, as well as large estates elsewhere in the Kingdom.

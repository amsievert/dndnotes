# Overview
The city of Falstor sits atop Reudan's Prominence, a low, flat hill that gives the city a panoramic view of the northern coastline of the Kingdom of Falstor. On the southeast side of the city, at the bottom of the hill is the city of Dalonstor, often referred to as Falstor's sister city. The two are connected by a massive polished-stone staircase called the King's Steps.

Falstor is the capital city of the Kingdom of Falstor. The city is the home of the ruling king, as well as the richest families in the Kingdom. These families, the Royal Houses of Falstor, are all owners of different industries across the Kingdom. Each of them have manors in the city, as well as large estates elsewhere in the Kingdom.
## Population
The city of Falstor has a population of around 84,250 people (55% Humans, 29% Half-Elves, 11% Elves, 5% Other). The general population of the city would be considered upper class when compared to the other cities of Falstor. Those that are not a part of the Royal Houses, are still rich merchants and artisans, or come from old money.
## Government
As the capital city of the Kingdom, Falstor is run by the King and the King's Council, which is made up of other members from the King's House. The King himself, who becomes the patriarch of his own house upon coronation, holds the final say in all court decisions. He is not obligated to listen to his council, but Kings often do because to not would put many blades at their back from their own family.

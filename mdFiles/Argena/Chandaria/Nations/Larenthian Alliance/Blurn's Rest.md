Blurn's Rest is a trading hub and rest stop for merchant caravans travelling between cities in the [Larenthian Alliance](The%20Larenthian%20Alliance.md). It sits at the Four Corners Crossroads in between [[Galvenport]] and [[Argena/Chandaria/Nations/Larenthian Alliance/Provinces/Holfirth Province/Holfirth]]. The owner, a large friendly Firbolg named Blurn, mans a tavern and inn named Blurn's Cairn. The main feature of the tavern is a tower of large stones that rises through the center of the building, making it visible for many miles around. Besides Blurn's Cairn, Blurn's Rest has a few market stalls where merchants and local farmers sell goods to travelers. There are also many tents set up where people rest while travelling.

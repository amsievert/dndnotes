Jequith is built over the water in Umeqen Bay. Much of the city is connected with canals.

The city is made of concentric rings with large canals, almost like moats, that mark the borders of the rings.

### Locations
#### Harborfront/Salt Quay
The busiest of the rings, it faces out into the bay. It is home to the docks and the markets. Lanterns and signal masts line the piers.

# Berserker's Rest
The capital city of Norlund, Berserker's Rest sits on the Stalwart River, north of the Champion's Range. The river allows the city to trade with the other towns and villages of Norlund. 

The ruling government of Norlund is based in Berserker's Rest, but it is a loose binding. Norlund is ruled by the strongest warrior clan heads in the land, and they usually don't favor living in the capital.

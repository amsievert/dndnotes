# Frostgate
#### Population
The population of Frostgate is 21,345 (51% Humans, 29% Dwarves, 13% Elves, 7% Other)
#### Government
Like all other cities in Norlund, Frostgate is ruled by it's Chieftain. However, the Chieftain of Frostgate holds additional responsibilities, as the Chieftain also holds the title of Riftkeeper. The Riftkeeper is in charge of keeping the Frostfire Engine burning.

The Chieftain must constantly fight to keep the position. The only way to stake an official claim to the position is through combat. Anyone who has killed another in a battle and whose family owns land is able to challenge the Chieftain to combat.
#### Defense
Frostgate sits behind a wooden palisade that was constructed during the Arcane Resurgence when the city was first founded. The wall is made of Elderbark, and it's said the magic of the trees make the wood more resilient than stone. 

In addition to the wall, every citizen in Frostgate is ready to take up arms at a moment's notice, willing to give their lives to defend the city from outside invaders from their own plane, or that beyond the gate.
#### Commerce
Like most cities in Norlund, Frostgate has very little contact with the world beyond Norlund. Many exotic goods are not available in the city, and the city's markets consist of mostly local goods.
#### Organizations
##### Mages of Fire
The Mages of Fire are the people in charge of managing the actual melting down of magical items in the Engine. They are masters in the Ritual of Flame, the complicated rite of ensuring that the magic of the artifacts is correctly harnessed by the Engine. Out in public, members of the Mages of Fire are extremely easy to spot, sporting bright red incandescent robes that seem to shimmer like embers in the sun.
##### Crystal Archivists
The Crystal Archivists maintain the Crystal Archives, Norlund's largest collection of arcane knowledge. The Crystal Archives are carved out of a massive ice crystal cavern beneath the city. The job of the Archivists is to take notes on every single magic item that is melted in the Frostfire Engine. The Crystal Archives are heavily guarded, as it contains nearly 2,000 years of magical item blueprints.
##### Snowstalkers
The Snowstalkers are masters of the wild tundra. It is their duty to scour the wilderness for magical items and artifacts to fuel the Frostfire Engine. They are rangers, scouts, and druids alike, all masters of traveling and surviving the harsh wastes of the north.
##### Cryomancer's Cult
The Cryomancer's Cult is a group dedicated to reopening the portal to the Frostfell and embracing it's power. They believe that the Frostfell could be tamed, it's power harnessed to control a kingdom. Members of the cult embrace all things cold and ice, and they renounce the Ritual of Flame.
#### History
During the Arcane Resurgence, overambitious mages opened a portal to the Frostfell and were consequently destroyed. The portal remained, and it took a great group of heroes to regain control of the gate and subdue its power. The portal created by the initial Frost Mages couldn't be permanently closed because the tear in the Interplanar Fabric was too large and there was too much energy leaking through the rift, but they were able to create a device called the Frostfire Engine, to emit its own energy and balance out the instability of the rift, keeping it closed as long as the Engine had magical energy. The magical energy needed to be derived from melted down magic items, and thus the Mages of Fire were founded. They remain to this day the keepers of the Engine.

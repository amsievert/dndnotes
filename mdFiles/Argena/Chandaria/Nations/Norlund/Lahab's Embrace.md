# Lahab's Embrace
Located in the north of The Spine, Lahab's Embrace sits nestled between two mountain peaks, looking over the Azure Expanse to the north. People from all over Norlund flock to Lahab's Embrace, as it is the premiere place for viewing the Aurora's that form over the Northern Expanse. 

The town derives its name from Lahab, the Father of Fire Elementals, for whom it is said heats the town. All over it there are hot springs, which are said to be portals to the Plane of Fire. Locals thank Lahab for the heat provided by the springs.

# Vulfen
#### Population
The population of Vulfen is 32,367 (41% Elves, 35% Humans, 20% Dire Wolves (Shtor), 4% Other)
#### Government
Vulfen's government is slightly different than the rest of the cities of Norlund, it has two rulers instead of one. One of them, the Chieftain, rules over the humanoids of the city. The other, the Beastspeaker, maintains control over the sentient Dire Wolves, known as the Shtor, and shifters of the city. The Beastspeaker's job is by far harder than the Chieftain's, as the Beastspeaker is charged with maintaining the delicate relationship between the sentient Dire Wolves and the bestial Dire Wolves, simply known as bestials, that are bred for the army.
#### Defense
The defense of Vulfen relies solely on the wolves raised there. The city has no walls, but instead has open fields that surround the city, allowing the dire wolves to attack at full capacity during a siege.
#### Commerce
The Vulpine Market at the center of Vulfen is the center of a vast trade network that runs throughout eastern Norlund. Other than Dire Wolves, Vulfen has no other major exports. However, it does have access to some exotic imported goods that are delivered by the merchants that come to pick up Dire Wolves.

Vulfen is also known for Gyldmen Heights, a neighborhood of large manors belonging to the richest merchants in the city. Gyldmen Heights sits built on the side of a large hill on the western edge of the city. 
#### Organizations
##### The Silversmiths
Because of all the werewolves that prowl the Vulfenwood, silver working is a very prominent skill. Every town, village, and hamlet in or near the Vulfenwood needs silvered weapons to defend themselves. The Silversmiths are similar to a guild and they operate out of Vulfen. Their primary concern is keeping the price of silver reasonable and making sure that every Silversmith in the province has enough supply.
##### Breeder's Guild
The Breeder's Guild concerns themselves mostly with the production of bestial Dire Wolves. They ensure that the breeding is done ethically and they manage the trading of the bestials to other cities. This guild is often under scrutiny from some Shtor that believe that all Dire Wolves should be treated equal.
##### Moonlight Mercenaries
The Moonlight Mercenaries are a very decentralized organization of adventurers, fighters, and rangers that patrol the Vulfenwood and protect the passing travelers. The Chieftain of Vulfen is responsible for allocating funds to the mercenaries, as they don't take payment from those they protect. Some mercenaries are also available in Vulfen to be hired to protect travelers on their way out.
##### Cult of Balinor
The Cult of Balinor operates within Vulfen. They are dedicated to preserving the sanctity of the hunt, and ensuring fair living conditions for all beasts. They are firmly against the breeding of bestials in Vulfen. They believe that every creature should have the opportunity to fight for its own freedom during a hunt.
#### History
Vulfen was founded as a sanctuary within the Vulfenwood. The local villagers within the forest were being overrun by werewolves. A small group of them eventually found sanctuary with some sentient Dire Wolves they found living out of a small cave den. They were shocked by the civility of these Wolves, and they eventually learned to live together, creating a safe haven in the middle of the Vulfenwood.

As Vulfen grew bigger, they needed a way to gain money. The original Shtor, who looked down on the bestial Dire Wolves, proposed the taming and selling of bestials for war. This turned out to be an insanely profitable business.

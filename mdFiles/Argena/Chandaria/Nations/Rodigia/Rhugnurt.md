The capital city of Rodigia. It sits atop Mount Thogrin, and is ruled by the Mountain King Strullar Anling. The top of Mount Thogrin itself has multiple peaks, all of which make up the actual city of Rhugnurt.

Many of the farmers that work on these terrace farms are Hill Giants, since crop farming is seen as a lesser occupation. It is reserved for those at the bottom of the Ordning.

They have the movement capability of mountain goats, but a much greater carrying capacity. To outsiders it can be very strange at first to see these massive creatures climbing near-vertical cliff faces around Rhugnurt, but Monties have been domesticated for millennia and are a staple of Giant society.

While the Monties are the go-to land mounts, the skies are ruled by the

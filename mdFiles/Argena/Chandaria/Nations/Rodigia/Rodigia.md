# Rodigia
Capital City: Rhugnurt

Prior to the Kingdom's founding, the area of Rodigia was a smattering of steadings of Giants that had inhabited the land for thousands of years. During this time, the land was called Jotunst채ll. Many of the families of Jotunst채ll claim descendance from Annam the Progenitor or his offspring.

The Kingdom of Rodigia was founded in 190 PS, following the [Rending of Skies](An%20Overall%20History%20Of%20Chandaria). The Kingdom was founded because an extremely powerful Storm Giant by the name of Stronmar, who at the time was living alone atop Mount Thogrin, was able to channel enough of his own tempestuous power to dispel Thalroth's storm over Jotunst채ll. Stronmar claimed that his power came from his bloodline which was descended directly from Stronmaus himself. Stronmar used this victory and his lineage to declare himself at the top of the Ordning. All of the giants living in Jotunst채ll were awestricken by Stronmar's power, and they rallied behind him, fearing a retaliatory attack from Thalroth. Thus, the Kingdom of Rodigia was founded (Stronmar renamed the land to cement his legacy), with Stronmar as the first Mountain King.

Capital City: Spellhaven

[[Spellhaven]] is the most technologically advanced city in Chandaria. Magic in this city is extremely commonplace, and used in nearly all facets of society. The city is in the center of the island, and has 8 roads, The Arcane Byways, leading out from the center, each one going to a town dedicated to one of the schools of magic. 
The Sanctum Arcana is the largest collection of knowledge and texts in Chandaria. It is very private and heavily guarded.

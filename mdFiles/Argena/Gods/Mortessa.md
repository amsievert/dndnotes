# Mortessa
True Neutral goddess of death. She presides over the Scales of Life in the Outlands.

People who follow the teachings of Mortessa don't necessarily follow a particular alignment. Mortessa herself is True Neutral because she decides where each soul goes to spend the afterlife. Her followers are not trying to emulate her being, they are instead focused on guiding those who seek a certain lot in the afterlife. Priests of Mortessa, the most powerful of which are known as Raven Kings and Queens, have their own ideas of alignment, some may be lawful good while others might be chaotic evil. The unifying idea between all of the priests is that they will offer guidance to those who seek to live their life in a certain alignment.
In society, it is those in the service of Mortessa that handle funeral rites and ensure that the dead get the proper treatment so that their souls may depart peacefully and easily to the Scales of Life and then to whichever outer plane Mortessa sees fit. It is a common belief that if the dead aren't treated to proper funeral rites that their souls might become lost on the way to the Outlands and they may end up as wandering spirits or ghosts.

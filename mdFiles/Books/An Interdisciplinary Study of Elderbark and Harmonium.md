There is no doubt that the current era will be one known for its great discoveries and leaps forward in arcane progress. Us Kainomancers have indeed brought about a new age of the world and will be remembered forever. The two greatest discoveries we have made are the Elderbark trees and Harmonium crystals. I feel no need to redescribe the intricacies of either of these powers, but instead will be deeply investigating the interactions between the two materials and their possible synergistic properties.

Despite being discovered many decades ago, the Elderbark trees still withhold their greatest secrets from us. We know that they are incredibly old and hold some amount of ancient magic in their roots, but the purpose and source of this energy still eludes us.

Similarly, the newly discovered Harmonium crystals still hold many secrets as well. It seems as though these crystals also hold some sort of ancient magic as well, but perhaps of a different source. From what we know, the Harmonium crystals are mostly concentrated in the Kingdom of Rodigia, while the Elderbark trees grow exclusively among the Westerwood.

Because of their inherent similarities, I decided to investigate what would happen if they interacted. I first collected some Harmonium from one of the mines in Rodigia and traveled to a small town called Pylith on the west coast of the continent. The town is built on Pre-Dissension ruins so I figured it would be a good place to perhaps learn more about the Elderbark trees and might have a connection to the land's energy.

I had a piece of Elderbark imported from the Sanctum Arcana and began experimenting. The two different subjects had no immediate reaction to each other. I was disappointed but pushed further.

Final Findings:
It seems that when exposed to conjuration magic, the harmonium reacted expectedly, amplifying the spell, which caused an amplified reaction in the Elderbark subject, absorbing the energy of the spell and storing it. The location of the spell's energy is still inconclusive. It is unclear whether the spell was stored or dissipated by the Elderbark.

Regardless, it seems that the Elderbark trees have some sort of relation to conjuration magic. This makes me think that they may be somehow related to teleportation. Since they are so old, they might have a different spatial understanding of the world, which may have been incomplete when they were first planted.

Addendum (In handwritten Draconic): The trees do so much more than teleportation. The roots are paths to different planes. The rest of my findings are too powerful for the world right now. I have hidden them deep within the Westerwood. Some day the world may be ready, but not yet.

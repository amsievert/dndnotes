We buried yet another body today. Another one of the priests willingly went to her Goddess lady of death. However, with this experiment I believe that no more priests need meet their Goddess. I have always been curious of the nature of the well of life force that the soul seems to carry inside it. I believe today that we found where this well comes from. As the priest passed, we measured energy connections made inside the body, and found that a great number of strong connections were immediately severed in her final moment. These connections seemed to go from the wells of strength in the body to some unknown ending. I believe that the body is connected to the soul through these lines, and that the body somehow supplies the soul with its life force which then breathes consciousness into a person. I need to think over my reasoning and consider all the evidence, but I believe we've reached a breakthrough here.

Today we prepared what I'm calling "The Final Ritual". I decided to bestow the honor of being the first mortal to ascend to true immortality on my gracious and ingenious apprentice Dravennon. He eagerly accepted the honor and was excited to give us the step up on the Gods that we so desperately need. Today we prepared the Altar. We built it to the north where I believe the connection to the Weave is the strongest. This shouldn't be necessary but it should give us a slightly better chance of success should something go awry. Tonight me and the priests prepared the runes on Dravennon that should bind his soul to the body. While they did that, I prepared the sacrificial blade, which should divert the soul's energy back to the body when it enters the body. I'm finding it hard to sleep tonight being on the cusp of greatness. Tomorrow we finally turn the tide in this war.

No no no no no. This can't be. Something terrible happened. The ritual was supposed to work. All the runes were perfect I made sure. Everything was perfect. I don't get it. It must have been sabotage. The gods must have known about this. NO. This island is so remote there's no way they have any idea what's going on here. Why then at the moment of greatness did the whole island erupt in magical energy and destroy everything. Had I not thrown up a ward at the last moment I would have been caught too. I just need to calm down and think.

There is no possible way I could have been wrong. I considered everything, there were no sources where error could have crept its sneaking fingers into this great endeavor. Should fate not be on our side? We fight against tyranny and it seems that even fate seeks to oppress us. Oh my poor apprentice. You should have become great. You would have ushered in a new era to the world.

it's not fair. why should the best of us be taken in pursuit of freedom. these halls seem so empty now. nothing matters anymore. clearly we tried to break too far out of our lot in life. idon’t know what to do anymore. there is nothing to do. i give up

16th of Aestia, 426 YD
The halls. I can still hear you. It's been two weeks since the accident and I can still hear you. You mock me. I wont give in to your torment. At all moments of the day you torture me but I am strong. I traced the source of your voice to the crypt and found some sort of portal or rift. Are you still alive. Are you in there? I will find you.

18th?? of Aestia, 426 YD i don’t know anymore
I'm coming. I'm heading through the portal. I know you're alive in there. I will bask in the glory of my great creation. I'm tasking the priests with taking care of this forsaken place and finding a new apprentice for me. There is a bright one among them, Lirin. She will never be you but she will be good.

19th of Aestia, 426 YD
I can't let them know of you yet. Not until I witness your perfection. My apprentice. My friend. Today I erased all memory of you and placed a curse on all of the priests if they ever should ever find and dare utter your name again. I kept a vial of your blood and will use it to key the portal along with your name. I will find you.

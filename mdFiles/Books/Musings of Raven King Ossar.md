I must write these thoughts here due to the loneliness of my oath. For if I am unable to uphold our oath of silence, what sort of paragon am I? I write here to relieve the burden associated with my unique position. I know of what Archmage Invexeor did to the reverent priests herein. He was so overcome with grief that he tried to erase all knowledge of his failed experiment. He modified the memory of all the priests to erase their knowledge of his apprentice that even now I dare not name, even though I remember. I remember everything. Oh my poor brothers and sisters, you deserve to know the truth, but I know I mustn't burden you as well. Invexeor was never aware of the boon granted to me by our great lady. He never understood the divine very well. Through my service of Mortessa I was granted a boon of protection that shielded my mind from all intrusions. When Invexeor wiped the memories of all the priests here, the divine protection held strong and prevented my memory from being altered.

I stayed silent for the past decades, but now I must take action. I received a portent from Mortessa recently, informing me of the defeat of the Archmages. She was unable to tell me of Invexeor's fate, but I know he is alive out there somewhere. I suspect that some time in between now and when he first lost his mind with grief, he ascended to lichdom. It seems to be the logical conclusion.

Given this, I need to find him before he does something reckless. Despite all of our disagreements, I still yearn to know of his fate and to check in on his wellbeing once more. I'm leaving Lirin in charge here to act as an interim leader, but I suspect she will want to leave this gods-forsaken island behind as well and will pick someone else to lead. With this I am travelling through the portal, for it is the only lead I have on Invexeor's whereabouts.

Knowledge is my burden,

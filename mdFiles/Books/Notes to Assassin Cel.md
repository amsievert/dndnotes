Cel,
I need you to eliminate Councilman Lars Kline. He is getting far too close to blowing this whole operation wide open. I believe he has learned the truth about the Elderbark trees. This cannot come to term. I cannot stress this next part enough, this must appear as an accident.

Cel,
You did great work with Lars. Those incompetent constables are tripping over their own feet trying to figure out what happened to the Councilman. However, I require your services again. I fear that Councilwoman Stonechild will soon drop her support of my cause. This could cause Lysander to turn on me and that cannot be. I need her eliminated in the same method as Lars. I apologize for the quick turnaround on this, your pay will be double the last.

My fellow brothers and sisters,
I am hereby declaring that all worship be relocated to the remains of Hithva. The ARID temple is no longer safe for our operations to continue within. We are still in the process of establishing a permanent settlement inside Hithva, but some of our kin are working tirelessly to finish construction as soon as possible. When leaving, please take any personal effects with you as we do not want any rogue actors to steal and use them for nefarious purposes. The ARID temple will be closed indefinitely exactly two weeks from now. Anything left inside will be sealed there for eternity.

Our oath is our curse,
Raven King Ossar

We have discovered a very curious nature of some of the altars in our experimentation chambers. It seems as if when beings are killed atop the altar, there is a chance that a part of their essence gets trapped in the altar. We first discovered this when we attempted to use the blood of one of our subjects to resurrect them, but it instead resurrected the original subject that died on the altar. We experimented further and it seemed that regardless of who was sacrificed on that altar, they always spilled the blood of the original subject. We built more altars in an attempt to learn more about this phenomenon. Curiously, this binding effect only bound certain subjects' essence to the altar. Moreover, it seems as though the more powerful the subject, the more likely that their essence is to be bound. I suspect that this has something to do with the inherent power present in every being's soul. Some aspect of the violence of the rending of soul from body causes a part of the soul to become trapped in the altar.

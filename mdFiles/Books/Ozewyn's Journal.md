The weight of this shield is too much to bear. With a tool designed to protect the vulnerable, I instead brought forth the deaths of thousands. What fools we Archmages were, the Gods were right to banish us. I know not of where my other companions were sent, but I hope they are forced to rot in Carceri along with me. In fact, let them rot longer. Explosive Usigaell and that trickster Ileus did more damage than I could have possibly imagined. I hope after they spend eternity in Carceri they spend many more eternities in the deepest pit of the Abyss.

With nothing but time to think, I have had a revelation! I shall not spend eternity here in prison. For when I was but an aspirant mage, I did perhaps the smartest thing possible. During my tutelage under Harmonia, I created a ward without her knowledge. Shame on me for going behind the back of the Weavemother. But alas, that ward may now save me. I remember being scared of what might happen to me during the war and creating a ward that would return me to its location if ever I was about to be killed. However, without upkeep, that ward would only last about a century. Now if my arithmetic is correct, that ward's lifespan is almost up. When it breaks, I am almost certain that it should activate, and will break me out of Carceri. These weeks of wait are the longest since my arrival here.

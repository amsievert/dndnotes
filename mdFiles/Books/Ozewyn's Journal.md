Verna 13, 2 PS

The weight of this shield is too much to bear. With a tool designed to protect the vulnerable, I instead brought forth the deaths of thousands. What fools we Archmages were, the Gods were right to banish us. I know not of where my other companions were sent, but I hope they are forced to rot in Carceri along with me. In fact, let them rot longer.

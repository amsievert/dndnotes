Current Day: 21st of Florum, 2506 PS

Political Questline:
When returning to Welbenwallow, the party is informed that Lars Kline has recently died in an unfortunate accident. The official report is that he died from drunkenly falling and hitting his head on his desk in his house's study.

He died the day before the party arrived. The crime scene is currently closed off and guarded by city guards. The detective mages have activated a time-stop rune on the house to prevent any more decay on anything in the house.

What actually happened: Lars has a reputation for being a bit of an alcoholic. He always keeps a bottle of whiskey at his desk to drink from during his late nights pouring over legal documents. However, the Spellhaven mages poisoned his whiskey with wyvern toxin. This caused him to stand up and stumble around alarmed, before dying and falling, hitting his head on the corner of the desk, making it look like an accident.

Crime Scene:
Lars's death happened in the second floor study of his Skyward district townhouse. His body lies face down, sprawled out on the floor near the desk, a pool of dried blood surrounding the body. His head has a large gash on the temple where it smashed on the corner of the desk. A smashed drinking glass lays on the ground next to the body.

Clues:
The Whiskey Bottle: A Bearclaw brand bottle of 100 proof whiskey. The whiskey bottle only has about an eighth of the content left. A DC 18 investigation or perception check notices that the whiskey smells a little off. A check with alchemist's or brewers supplies makes the DC 13.

The Body: The body lies face down in the pool of dried blood. A DC 18 medicine check reveals a closing of the wind pipe that indicates poisoning. The poison used was Purple Worm Poison, made using Purple Worm Slime.

The Desk: A lot of the documents on the desk are related to the Spellhaven agreement and the Crimson Brand's contract. In the middle of the desk is a letter from a politician named Erin Tachne. The letter is telling Lars to stop investigating the Spellhaven agreement and to just fall in line with the rest of the Council. A DC 15 investigation check reveals that there were definitely more papers on the desk that aren't there anymore.

The Roof: There is a single footprint on the roof that can be found with a DC 18 investigation/survival check. The footprint does not match any of the shoes in the house. The boot's print has a unique honeycomb pattern on it. Based on the wear of the print, it was left some days before the night of the murder.

Possible Paths:
Investigating Bearclaw Distillery:
The Bearclaw Distillery also acts as a store. It's the only place to get bottles like the one that Lars had. The worker at the front has no idea about the bottle, but with some pressure can get the party an audience with the manager of the distillery. The manager, Phil McHenry, denies having any connection to the murder. A DC 10 perception/arcana check reveals that Phil is covered with a disguise self spell. The spell is only altering his face, which underneath has a black eye and a big bruise on his cheek. With some convincing, he admits that there was a shady individual that came around a few days ago asking about what kind of whiskey that Lars liked to drink. When Phil refused, the shady character beat him pretty bad until he gave in.

Investigating the Thieves Guild:
The Thieves Guild will be pretty hard to investigate, since the Guild knows all of the party members are associated with the theft of the scroll. If any of the party members are seen in the Guild hall, the guards attempt to apprehend them and interrogate them. Asking why they stole the scroll and who they are working for. The NPCs in the Guild Hall are half Spy stat blocks and half Thug stat blocks. Any of the named NPCs are Master Thief stat blocks. In terms of clues, in the alchemy lab, a ledger shows that someone named Cel ordered Purple Worm Poison on the 15th of Florum. Also, in the leader's office, Tony keeps a list of all incoming correspondence, which shows that a Councilman named Seris Durn ordered the assassination of Lars on the 10th of Florum.

Investigating Erin Tachne:
A meeting can be set up with Erin, just like any of the other Council members. She is a very shrewd politician who is very blunt and pragmatic, which can come off cold. However, she is not an evil person, and is not the killer. The only information that she can provide for the investigation is background on the deal with Spellhaven. She knows that the Spellhaven mages are giving the city shipments of Harmonium, as well as blueprints for cutting edge arcane technology.

Finding Cel:
Cel has the 2025 Assassin stat block. If she is killed, she has a note on her essentially ordering her to kill Lars Kline, sent from Councilman Seris Durn. Her boots also have the unique honeycomb pattern on them.

Resolution:
Once a suspect is found, they can be reported to the No'zaral overseers, since they work independently of the city's authority. They work instead for the Free Congress of No'zaral, and will arrest the suspect.

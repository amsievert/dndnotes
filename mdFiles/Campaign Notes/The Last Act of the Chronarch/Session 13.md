Current Day: 23rd of Florum, 2506 PS

The next morning that the party wakes up, Leto receives a sending message from the Thieve's Guild informing him that they have a job for the party to make up for their prior transgressions.

The mission is to assist a guild operative on an operation. If the party accepts, Tony tells them that the operative will be in contact with them very soon. On the way back from the Guild, someone on the street bumps into one of the party members and apologizes before secretly handing them a note and disappearing into a crowd. The note reads: "Meet me at Perpetual Plaza after sunset. Will brief there. -C".

That night at the Perpetual Plaza, Cel (wearing the honeycomb boots) meets the party and tells them that she needs them to help with something. All they have to do is create a distraction outside of Councilwoman Greta Stonechild's manor, while she sneaks in to steal something.

If the party does nothing, Cel sneaks in and kills Greta. Otherwise, they can interrupt at any time.

Ysaldan Vhal's Magnum Opus
In her note from the tower, Vhal mentions that her Magnum Opus is hidden within the Westerwood. This Magnum Opus is the Void Seal. Using the ancient magic of the Elderbark trees, she traveled to the edge of the universe and collected some of the Void fragments from there and crafted them into the Void Seal. She created this artifact at the end of the Arcane Resurgence as she realized the troubles that magic was bringing into the world.

However, sometime during the Age of Peace, local explorers stumbled upon Vhal's laboratory and alerted higher authorities, who took the Void Seal and separated it into pieces and sent these pieces far away from each other. The power of the Void Seal couldn't be completely destroyed however, and even the pieces on their own hold great power. Some of the pieces are on Chandaria while others were sent to other planes. They have since changed hands from the original beings that held them, but they can be tracked down.

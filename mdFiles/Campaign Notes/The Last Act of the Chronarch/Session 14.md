**Ysaldan Vhal's Magnum Opus**
In her note from the tower, Vhal mentions that her Magnum Opus is hidden within the Westerwood. This Magnum Opus is the Void Seal. Using the ancient magic of the Elderbark trees, she traveled to the edge of the universe and collected some of the Void fragments from there and crafted them into the Void Seal. She created this artifact at the end of the Arcane Resurgence as she realized the troubles that magic was bringing into the world.

However, sometime during the Age of Peace, local explorers stumbled upon Vhal's laboratory and alerted higher authorities, who took the Void Seal and separated it into pieces and sent these pieces far away from each other. The power of the Void Seal couldn't be completely destroyed however, and even the pieces on their own hold great power. Some of the pieces are on Chandaria while others were sent to other planes. They have since changed hands from the original beings that held them, but they can be tracked down.

**Aftermath of the investigation**
5 days have past since last session. In that time, Seris's trial has concluded and the sentencing happens in the Perpetual Plaza. Overseer Oswald carries out the sentencing: "Seris Durn, you have been found guilty of Conspiracy to Murder, Bribery, Fraud, and Treason of the highest order. You are hereby stripped of your position on the Welbenwallow Council and are banished from the Free Republic of No'zaral. This sentence is effective immediately." Seris is also branded with the mark of treason. The party is invited up on stage and are awarded with Bronze Heart awards, recognizing their service to the province.

Also in the 5 days, a memorial is held for Greta Stonechild. Because of what happened to her and the information that was uncovered, the council has rallied behind her and is getting ready to vote to end the contract with Spellhaven. Meriel knows that this is very likely to pass because of the outing of Seris.

Meanwhile, Esther hypothesizes that with the crackdown happening on the Spellhaven deal, Elminster has been forced to stop his plans for a time. However, now that word of the deal ending has been surfacing, he is likely to make a move soon.

**Traveling to the Void Fortress**
Heading south from Welbenwallow, the party arrives at Jequith in two and a half days.

Travel Encounters:
Halfway through the first day, another adventuring party walks past on the road. There are 4 of them in the group: Dram (Goliath Barbarian), Armyn (Elven Wizard), Delilah (Human Fighter), Bump (Halfling Rogue). They call themselves MXB because of the line that is made by their heights when they stand next to each other. These are the people that killed Roular and Jeff.

On the first night, whoever is keeping watch sees a meteor streak through the sky towards the Eternal Scorch. If they succeed on a DC 15 perception check, they see a dragon racing after the meteor through the sky. 

On the second day, as the party is traveling through a rocky part of the forest, they all hear a large explosion off in the rocks, followed by maniacal laughter. A gnome named Boomy is experimenting with black powder. He spent some time aboard a Captain Cymara's pirate ship in the Wildlands. Using what he learned about black powder there, he is trying to find a way to manufacture it here. Nearby is a cave with saltpeter crystals, which he is using to make the black powder. He also is trying a new method involving burying and watering his poop and then boiling the resulting crystals.

For the second night, the party camps in a cave in the rocks. Inside the cave are paintings, preserved by the climate controlled environment of the cave. The paintings depict the Age of Dragons. They show a massive lightning storm over the land and people cowering in fear. They also show primitive drawings of dragons flying around using their breath weapons on people. There is also a painting of a massive blue dragon atop a huge pile of gold. There is also evidence of fires that burned in here long ago.

On the third day, before reaching Jequith, the party encounters Jeff the Cronds salesman on the side of the road. He is trying to save up enough money to set up a stand in the city.

Late in the third day the party reaches [[Jequith]].

After leaving Jequith, it takes another three days to reach the Void Fortress.

On the second day of travel, the party comes across the camp of a small band of No'zaral Military soldiers. There are about 15 of them, led by a captain named Gorm (half-orc from Kul-Radein). The soldiers are guarding the border with the Atrisean Dynasty.

On the second night, an Oni hunts whoever is keeping watch. It's beady eyes watch from the dark.

Around mid-afternoon on the third day of travel, the party reaches the area that is indicated by Ysaldan's map.

The area is a small clearing with a hill on the far side, half covered with the treeline. The area here is naturally more hilly, since it is close to the Exalted Summit. The clearing itself doesn't have much, except for a few stones stacked in what could be the remnants of a small garden wall. Also beneath some leaves is an extremely dirty and cracked crystal ball about the size of a softball. This is an old arcane focus from the wizards that came to collect the Void Seal.

Hidden amongst the trees atop the hill on the far side of the clearing is a squat shack with a medium-sized telescope protruding from the roof. The building is made of stones similar to the ones in the garden wall and the whole thing is covered in ivy.

The door is locked and is made of metal with a circular window at head level.

Inside is a table and chair at the eyepiece of the telescope. On the table is a star chart labeled "Aloran Quadrant". It has four constellations on it, "The Dragon", "Mother Gith", "Annam", and "Void?" accompanied with a small journal entry written by Ysaldan.

In a corner of this room there is another small altar to Harmonia. This one lacks a Harmonium crystal.

There is also a small cot in another corner of the room.

Against the wall between the cot and the altar is a row of floor to ceiling bookcases, with a rolling ladder that slides along to allow access to the higher levels. Along the rail at the top, 5 elven words are etched into the metal:  "To Hold", "Sanctuary", "Knowledge", "Song", and "Crossroads". When the ladder is placed over a word and that word is spoken, the word alights. The words "Crossroads", "Song", then "Sanctuary" must be activated in that order to open one of the bookcases, revealing a creaky metal elevator operated by pully. On the elevator however is a large construct (Shield Guardian stat block) that has the insignia of Spellhaven (Eight pointed silver star surrounded by gold band) printed across its metal chestplate. It quickly scans the party then immediately attacks.

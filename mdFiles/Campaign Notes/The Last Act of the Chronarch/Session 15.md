**Ysaldan Vhal's Magnum Opus**
In her note from the tower, Vhal mentions that her Magnum Opus is hidden within the Westerwood. This Magnum Opus is the Void Seal. Using the ancient magic of the Elderbark trees, she traveled to the edge of the universe and collected some of the Void fragments from there and crafted them into the Void Seal. She created this artifact at the end of the Arcane Resurgence as she realized the troubles that magic was bringing into the world.

However, sometime during the Age of Peace, local explorers stumbled upon Vhal's laboratory and alerted higher authorities, who took the Void Seal and separated it into pieces and sent these pieces far away from each other. They also erased all information about where the fragments and the Void Fortress were. They then modified their own memories to erase that trace as well. The power of the Void Seal couldn't be completely destroyed however, and even the pieces on their own hold great power. Some of the pieces are on Chandaria while others were sent to other planes. They have since changed hands from the original beings that held them, but they can be tracked down.
#### Traveling to the Void Fortress
Around mid-afternoon on the third day of travel, the party reaches the area that is indicated by Ysaldan's map.

The area is a small clearing with a hill on the far side, half covered with the treeline. The area here is naturally more hilly, since it is close to the Exalted Summit. The clearing itself doesn't have much, except for a few stones stacked in what could be the remnants of a small garden wall. Also beneath some leaves is an extremely dirty and cracked crystal ball about the size of a softball. This is an old arcane focus from the wizards that came to collect the Void Seal.

Hidden amongst the trees atop the hill on the far side of the clearing is a squat shack with a medium-sized telescope protruding from the roof. The building is made of stones similar to the ones in the garden wall and the whole thing is covered in ivy.

The door is locked and is made of metal with a circular window at head level.

Inside is a table and chair at the eyepiece of the telescope. On the table is a star chart labeled "Aloran Quadrant". It has four constellations on it, "The Dragon", "Mother Gith", "Annam", and "Void?" accompanied with a small journal entry written by Ysaldan.

In a corner of this room there is another small altar to Harmonia. This one lacks a Harmonium crystal.

There is also a small cot in another corner of the room.

Against the wall between the cot and the altar is a row of floor to ceiling bookcases, with a rolling ladder that slides along to allow access to the higher levels. Along the rail at the top, 5 elven words are etched into the metal:  "To Hold", "Sanctuary", "Knowledge", "Song", and "Crossroads". When the ladder is placed over a word and that word is spoken, the word alights. The words "Crossroads", "Song", then "Sanctuary" must be activated in that order to open one of the bookcases, revealing a creaky metal elevator operated by pully. On the elevator however is a large construct (Shield Guardian stat block) that has the insignia of Spellhaven (Eight pointed silver star surrounded by gold band) printed across its metal chestplate. It quickly scans the party then immediately attacks.

The elevator only goes between this upper level and another chamber far below ground. It opens up into a small chamber with a projection of the starry sky suspended in a magically darkened ceiling. Beyond the antechamber is a library. The library has been completely ransacked, shelves knocked over, pages torn from books, and other scrape marks across the ground that lead out towards the elevator.

Between the ransacked library and the next room is a long corridor. As the party enters the corridor, they hear the elevator activate behind them, and can hear voices from the top of the shaft. A DC 14 perception check hears 3 voices, while a DC 19 perception check can distinguish one of them as Elminster's. 2 spellhaven mages begin descending into the lab at this point. In the corridor is a single skeletal arm with rotted cloth on it. Just past this arm, a disguised magical glyph activates when anyone gets too close to it, opening a 15 foot-long opening in the floor that attempts to swallow up people and quickly close to crush them. A DC 13 dexterity saving throw escapes the trap if it activates. At the bottom of the pit, crushed bones with cloth matching the arm can be seen.

The next room after the corridor is a seeming endlessly deep cavern with massive pillars of gears rising up from the darkness and connecting to the roof. The pillars are slowly turning, powering something. The gears form natural platforms to jump across, but there are more skeletal bodies on the gears. These ones don't have any broken bones but are leaned up against the pillars dead. As the party begins climbing across the gears, small homunculus fly up from below and begin pelting the crossers with darts and bites.

The next room is what the previous was powering, a massive machine that looks like a fusion reactor. The machine is shaped like a massive torus with wires and gear shafts attaching to it from the ceiling. In the center of the Torus is a small circular container, almost like a mould. Pistons from the ring look as if they could press in on the circle. The machine is currently off but there is a very obvious switch near the side of the room. This machine is what distilled the void essence into the Void Seal.

The final room is through a door labeled containment. Inside are two groups of bodies, one mages and one gith warriors. They died fighting each other. In the center of the room is a broken display case with a Void Fragment inside. Its power is tangible while standing in the room, and its unclear exactly why this Fragment is still here. In reality, the Void Seal was broken during this fight that happened in the containment area to allow the mages to defeat the gith defenders. This last fragment remains because it is bound to this area. Because so, as soon as it is touched, some of the gith skeletons reanimate and attack anyone else in the room. 3 Githyanki Warriors.

### The Elderbark Trees
On his journey back to his home town, Rango learns that the Elderbark Trees at the center of their village are smoking more than before. A sentry a few nights ago even claims to have seen the bark beginning to split open and flames lick out momentarily. The elders of the village have increased the power they are channeling into the trees to keep them healthy because of this.

What is really happening: A powerful entity from the Elemental Plane of fire possesses one of the Void Fragments, which is allowing them to channel the power of the Void Seal to rip through the Interplanar Fabric.

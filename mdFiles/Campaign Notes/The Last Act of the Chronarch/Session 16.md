Current Day: 1st of Calo, 2506 PS

The githyanki warriors instantly attack the party. Attack first, ask questions later. If most of the party goes down, the githyanki question the survivors.

As the fight is happening, Elminster and his two accomplices wait outside the machine room for the fight to finish before entering to clean up the rest.

Elminster's entire goal of the encounter is to leave with the Void Fragment and bring it back to Spellhaven to give to his boss, who he believes is Tannaeus (but is actually The Chronarch). 

Elminster knows that the Void Seal itself is a powerful conjuration artifact and that even just holding a fragment of it grants power.

His motivation for doing this is because he believes that by retrieving this Void Fragment, he will finally make his brother Tannaeus proud. He hates the party because they have constantly made him look like a fool for his brother. Elminster is the little brother of the Lysanders and he has only ever wanted to make his brother proud.
The most tragic part about this whole situation is that he is not even working for his brother, but instead is being manipulated by The Chronarch. 

If Elminster successfully obtains the Fragment, he leaves and starts travelling back to Spellhaven via the Jequith port. He also stabilizes any players that are down because his boss told him to. He has two revivify scrolls to give to the party if any party members are dead.

If Elminster doesn't obtain the Fragment, he will stop at nothing to get it, and will start to get very reckless.

Being attuned to a single void fragment grants the holder 3 charges to cast misty step and regains 1d3 charges during each long rest.

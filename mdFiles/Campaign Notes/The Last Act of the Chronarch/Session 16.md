Current Day: 1st of Calo, 2506 PS

The githyanki warriors instantly attack the party. Attack first, ask questions later. If most of the party goes down, the githyanki question the survivors.

As the fight is happening, Elminster and his two accomplices wait outside the machine room for the fight to finish before entering to clean up the rest.

Elminster's entire goal of the encounter is to leave with the Void Fragment and bring it back to Spellhaven to give to his boss, who he believes is Tannaeus (but is actually The Chronarch). 

Elminster knows that the Void Seal itself is a powerful conjuration artifact and that even just holding a fragment of it grants power.

His motivation for doing this is because he believes that by retrieving this Void Fragment, he will finally make his brother Tannaeus proud. He hates the party because they have constantly made him look like a fool for his brother.

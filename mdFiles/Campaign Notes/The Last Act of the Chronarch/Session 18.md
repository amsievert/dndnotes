As the one armed Elminster kneels on the bow of the ship, his form quivers with the power of the Void Shard. He is losing a lot of blood from multiple wounds across his body, most of all his missing arm. He looks at the ground momentarily before beginning a summoning ritual using the power of the Void Shard. The portal starts to appear on the ground in front of him and demonic chittering can be heard from the other side of the portal. The portal suddenly fizzles out before anything can come through. Elminster looks up surprised and sees Captain Kilgore limping forward through the flames on the ship's deck, having just counterspelled his Summon Lesser Demons spell.

Elminster's shoulders slump and he hangs his head defeated. Kilgore nods to the party and gestures for them to take the lead with Elminster. Elminster's breath is extremely labored and the blood continues pooling around him. He accepts his defeat and wishes for death rather than capture.

After dealing with Elminster, the party must deal with the fire aboard the ship (DC 15, page 201 GoS). Any perception checks made while this is happening sees a distant ship quickly turning away from the battle and heading towards Valdens.

After the fire has been extinguished, the crew sets about looting the sinking mage ship. Kilgore's ship can't steer towards Valdens until the next day, since they need to repair the destroyed helm.

The next day when the ship gets to shore, port authorities attempt to arrest the crew and the party. If arrested, they are taken to a jail in Mutas where the Party and Captain Kilgore are put in one cell, while the rest of the crew is split in other cells. Each cell is covered by a Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum spell preventing teleportation into and out of it.

The party is interrogated by the jail warden named Gilda Sunden. She asks for them to identify themselves and identify their relationship to Captain Kilgore.

After a day of being in jail, the Chronarch comes in and tells them that they are free to leave. He sees them and mentions that something seems very familiar about them and he has a lot of questions. He leads them out of the jail and towards the Byway Station in Mutas. He then takes them along the Byway to Spellhaven. The whole time he is asking them questions about their experiences before time travelling and after arriving in Lanbruk.

The Chronarch's Tower in Spellhaven is within the second ring. The tower rises high above the surrounding city blocks. He takes them up to his study near the top of the tower where he briefs them on what he believes is going on with the Void Seal.

He tells them about how he believes that the Void Seal was shattered years ago by mages from Spellhaven who then erased their own memories and destroyed any written information about the artifact. He also tells them about how they need to accumulate all of the shards here, in order to then take them to be destroyed. He isn't sure exactly how they can be destroyed yet, but he knows it will be an involved process. He also guesses that the shards still retain a portion of the power that was once vested in the original artifact. The shard that the party has allows them 3 charges with which to cast Summon Lesser Demons. The Chronarch believes that the different shards may contain different abilities, some potentially stronger. He is also uncertain of whether the shards may have some sort of corrupting nature to their wielder.

He ends by saying that he would like to work with the party to gather the shards of the seal to destroy them before Tannaeus can get them and start the apocalypse once again. He suggests that the party go after shards that have less powerful abilities first, since the beings in possession of those shards may be easier to take down.

The Chronarch has heard rumors from the Elemental Plane of Fire that sound like they could be due to a Shard-Wielder. He asks the party if they encountered anything along their travel thus far that could be related to this. This should hopefully lead the party to return to Rango's home village.

Once in Spellhaven, the party reaches level 5.

Current Day: 18th of Calo, 2506 PS

The party is left free to travel to Rango's village at their own time. The Chronarch gives them his pass to use the Arcane Byways to head north to Divi and cross the Londrias River into the Atrisean Dynasty.

In Divi, at the Londrias Crossing, the party must wait in a long line to board a ferry to cross the river. The ferries are owned independently by a group known as the Ferrymen. They were created long ago to avoid contention between Valdens and the Dynasty on ownership of the ferries themselves. However, each side of the crossing has a customs agency that will attempt to make things as hard as possible for travelers from the opposing nation.

While in the line for the ferries, a half-elf man approaches the party holding a wrapped up baby. His name is Marcus and he begs the party to take his baby Sali across the river to her mother, Lira (Elf, long light blond hair, bright green eyes). Marcus explains that he is an alchemist who was living in Spellhaven for the past few years with his family. However, his business recently fell on hard times because his wife had to move back to the Dynasty to deal with a family funeral. Now, he is trying to move back to be with his wife but is unable to cross because the Valdensian river guards saw his alchemical supplies and confiscated them claiming them to be contraband, and refused to let him cross on a ferry. He has no money and no place to stay but needs to stay behind to try to get back some of his supplies. He just wants his daughter to be safe with her mother over in Athalon.

The river guards inspect the party's packs and question them about their reasons for crossing. Around them, other Atrisean people are being turned away for ridiculous reasons.

It takes about 3 hours for a ferry to cross the Londrias. Disembarking from the ferry is much easier than getting on. Everyone rushes to get off as quickly as possible. Lira is waiting nearby the docks anxiously waiting, she thanks them so much for bringing her baby and asks what is happening with Marcus.

Athalon is a city of traders. From here, merchants send goods across into Valdens, around into Falstor, and up the Twin Straits to the Larenthian Alliance. The city is a maze of crisscrossing streets that have hundreds of wagons and caravans driving across at all times. Since the city's road network is very established already, the city doesn't expand outward, but rather upward. Much of the city is made of 10 to 12 story buildings made of stone and reinforced with rare metals. Athalon serves as the economic center of the dynasty. There are a wide mix of people hustling and bustling along the city streets. Anyone from business suits to adventurers traveling around.

Traveling further north from Athalon, the party passes into a thick forest with tall, skinny trees. Further into the forest, the party comes across a small roadside chapel. The building is no more than 20 feet by 20 feet. On one side of the front door is a carved wooden statue of [[Lucite]]. On the other side of the door is a carved wooden statue of God King Olym Teinithra. He is depicted with sharp features and short parted hair. He is holding a sword triumphantly in one hand and holding a spool of thread in the other. The chapel's door is open, and inside is a human woman praying to a gold idol of Lucite. The woman's name is Gelda and she is very old. She simply acts as an information NPC to give information about the region and the Dynasty if asked.

The next day, as the party continues they come across the grisly sight of a scorched body burned on a stake. The body is secured to the wooden post by a metal spike through the abdomen. A flat stone is driven into the ground in front of the body. The engraved stone bears the symbol of the [[Atrisean Dynasty|Dynasty]] and reads "False Prophet". There are also various pieces of garbage that have been dumped around the scene. A DC 12 investigation check finds a small bouquet of flowers tied with a piece of paper that reads "He will rise again".
This is the body of Greth Takar, a half-orc who attempted to liberate Filvadell from the Dynasty by claiming to be a direct descendent of Atrizar and also claimed to have spent time in Acheron where he met her. He spent 3 months preaching in Filvadell, spreading his word, before he was caught by members of the God King's Department of Cultural Doctrine and burned for being a false prophet and speaking against the God King's authority.

The following day, the party arrives in Filvadell. The city seems to be very on edge. Something that is immediately apparent in the city is the overwhelming number of cathedrals and religious temples. Within the city, there are large statues of Lucite, all adorned in gold and gems. Priests of Lucite walk around, openly displaying their faith with golden cords draped over their shoulders and around their necks. Somewhat strangely, state-sponsored gambling is huge in Filvadell. The center of the city is not a church, but instead a massive casino called "The Temple", which is a very strange mixture of actual temple with religious paraphernalia and wild casino with all kinds of games imaginable. They even have slot machines made of stone blocks that spin on an axle that have illusory script written on them. The inside of the casino smells heavily of incense.

Despite the casino and the other churches and cathedrals, there is an air of tension in the city. Those who don't openly wear Lucite gear, seem to steer clear of those that do. There also seems to be a strong presence of Luckguards here. A DC 15 perception or religion check finds people secretly displaying symbols of other Gods. Many of these people display the one-eyed symbol of Gruumsh, in support of the recently executed Greth Takar, who was caught only ten days ago.

Leaving Filvadell, the party soon enters the Atrisean Jungle. Unfortunately, the road west is much less traveled than the road north, which is wear most traders take their caravans into the Scorch and then to other nations from there. The road west is really only used by soldiers traveling to and from Fort Hanam.

The jungle is extremely hot, with temperatures over 100 degrees. Not only this, but the humid air is very suffocating for any not accustomed to it. Every day, all characters must make a DC 10 constitution saving throw, and on a fail take one level of exhaustion. Parts of the jungle road are overgrown with vines. The overgrowth here has marks where clearly wagons have attempted to pass over them. In one overgrown spot, the vines lead down a cliff. Over the edge of the cliff, caught in the vines is a cart that seems to have rode off the side of the road and been caught in the vines. It is dangling very precariously, but a DC 13 perception check sees loaded bags in the back of the cart. There are 5 bags that each have 1,000 silver pieces in them. The bags have the symbol of the Dynasty on them. They were wages for the soldiers at Fort Hanam, but they went missing here. Any serious weight will cause the cart to plummet into the undergrowth below, beneath which is a flowing river that sweeps the bags away.

On the 2nd night of traveling while resting, a friendly Treant named Treena approaches whoever is on watch and tries to strike up conversation. If there is a fire, she first asks them politely to put it out to protect the other jungle flora. She sits with the watch and remarks how it is nice to meet someone who isn't a soldier like those that normally pass through here. Unfortunately, by extinguishing their fire, the rest of the night is filled with mosquito bites.

On the fourth day of travel, the road passes near another cliff. This one has a wide waterfall, and the road passes through the shallow water near the edge of the waterfall. While traveling through this, the party is ambushed by three Carnotaurus. These dinosaurs have longer horns than a real carno and can use them to gore. The carnos have the triceratops gore attack and the Allosaurus bite attack. They can do one of each per turn and have a +8 attack bonus with a +5 damage bonus.

Towards the end of the fifth day of travel, the party finally reaches Fort Hanam. The fort is set in a large basin, where waterfalls flow down into, making a natural moat around the fort. The floor of the basin is about 75 feet down, and the top of the fort just crests over the lip of the basin. The road here splits, with one fork heading down a narrow cliffside path down into the basin, and another traveling around the edge for a bit before branching south towards Sangara.

On the first day of travel between Fort Hanam and Sangara, the party comes across the gruesome sight of another military convoy that was attacked by dinosaurs. The convoy consists of three carts, each of them empty, seemingly having already dropped off their supplies at the fort. All three of the carts are destroyed, and there is blood and viscera scatter all over the place. A metallic glint catches the parties eyes, and they see, about 40 feet up a massive tree, a dead caravan guard impaled on a broken tree branch. The guard has no head, but is wearing full plate armor that seems like it might fit Yorik.

During that night, the party hears heavy footsteps far off in the distance, followed by the cry of some sort of animal swiftly cut off by death. This is the sound of 2 t-rexes hunting in the area.

The following night, the T-rexes ambush the party. Their low vibrating vocalizations can be heard by whoever is on watch. A good perception check hears their padded footsteps slowly stalking around the edge of the camp. A bad perception check only sees the catlike eyes catching the fire for a moment before disappearing and getting a different ambush angle.

There are no more encounters before reaching Rango's village. Which is reached midway through the 4th day of travel.

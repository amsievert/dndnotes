Current Day: 4th of Florum, 2506 PS

The party awakes in a cow pasture. They are in a small farming village called Lanbruk. It sits just on the edge of the Reborn Forest. The village is currently experiencing tough times as their stores are being run dry by the occupying force, known as the Crimson Brand. The Crimson Brand is a mercenary band that operates in the Welbenwallow province.

After a bit of roleplay and exploration of the town, a group of 2 hobgoblins and 1 human thug walk into the village and start demanding food from the innkeeper. They demand 5 barrels of grain. The innkeeper says that giving up that much grain would send his business under. They start breaking things in the tavern until he agrees to give them the five barrels. The party is free to interfere at any time. There is a caveat to the whole situation, the Crimson Brand kidnapped his son as an insurance policy. The brutes that show up at the tavern can be tracked back to their small camp, where the son is guarded by 2 more thugs and 3 more hobgoblins.

Reborn Forest: Part of the Westerwood that was heavily deforested during the Arcane Resurgence. Many druids worked very hard to replant the region and grow it back to its former glory.

Lanbruk Inhabitants:
Mayor: Kiri Lanorys (Female Tiefling)
Blacksmith: Dreok Hammerfist (Male Dwarf)
Innkeeper: Aylward Grassel (Male Half-Elf)
Carpenter: Eberdeb Stumpydump (Female Gnome)
Cowherd: Grum Stamling (Male Human)
Farmer: Stephen Osmer (Male Half-Elf)

If the party ever leaves Lanbruk, they encounter a checkpoint where members of the Crimson Brand ask if they have any maps or books related to the Westerwood or the Elderbark trees.

Welbenwallow notes:
Essentially ruled by the Clockwork Consortium. Automatons called striders patrol the streets and help citizens carry things. There are all sorts of clockwork machines around the city.

Elderbark trees used to connect to Beastlands? Closed by Lizard Gods?

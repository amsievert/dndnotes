Current Day: 24th of Calo, 2506 PS

On the first day of travel between Fort Hanam and Sangara, the party comes across the gruesome sight of another military convoy that was attacked by dinosaurs. The convoy consists of three carts, each of them empty, seemingly having already dropped off their supplies at the fort. All three of the carts are destroyed, and there is blood and viscera scatter all over the place. A metallic glint catches the parties eyes, and they see, about 40 feet up a massive tree, a dead caravan guard impaled on a broken tree branch. The guard has no head, but is wearing full plate armor that seems like it might fit Yorik.

During that night, the party hears heavy footsteps far off in the distance, followed by the cry of some sort of animal swiftly cut off by death. This is the sound of 2 t-rexes hunting in the area.

The following night, the T-rexes ambush the party. Their low vibrating vocalizations can be heard by whoever is on watch. A good perception check hears their padded footsteps slowly stalking around the edge of the camp. A bad perception check only sees the catlike eyes catching the fire for a moment before disappearing and getting a different ambush angle.

There are no more encounters before reaching [[Tree and Scale Village|Rango's V]]. Which is reached midway through the 4th day of travel.

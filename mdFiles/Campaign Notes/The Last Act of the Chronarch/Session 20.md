Current Day: 24th of Calo, 2506 PS
# Jungle Travel
On the first day of travel between Fort Hanam and Sangara, the party comes across the gruesome sight of another military convoy that was attacked by dinosaurs. The convoy consists of three carts, each of them empty, seemingly having already dropped off their supplies at the fort. All three of the carts are destroyed, and there is blood and viscera scatter all over the place. A metallic glint catches the parties eyes, and they see, about 40 feet up a massive tree, a dead caravan guard impaled on a broken tree branch. The guard has no head, but is wearing full plate armor that seems like it might fit Yorik.

During that night, the party hears heavy footsteps far off in the distance, followed by the cry of some sort of animal swiftly cut off by death. This is the sound of 2 t-rexes hunting in the area.

The following night, the T-rexes ambush the party. Their low vibrating vocalizations can be heard by whoever is on watch. A good perception check hears their padded footsteps slowly stalking around the edge of the camp. A bad perception check only sees the catlike eyes catching the fire for a moment before disappearing and getting a different ambush angle.

There are no more encounters before reaching [[Tree and Scale Village|Rango's Village]]. Which is reached midway through the 4th day of travel.
# In Tree and Scale
## Overview
The village Elders are against any idea of trying to follow the fire monsters back through the tree. They claim that to do so would invite only trouble to the village. They also claim that they are currently busy planning for the celebration of an elder's recent death. One of the Elders says that maybe if Rango and friends can win the Garmior (Bloodball) tournament leading up to the celebration, he will talk to them further about possibilities at the actual celebration.

At the actual celebration, everything seems to be going very well and everyone is having a fantastic time. Late into the night while the festivities are still raging on, the Mother tree suddenly opens and multiple fire elementals and a large elemental (Efreeti) burst through and begin laying waste to the village. This would seem strange to Rango, since he knows that raids like this shouldn't be happening for a few years, something is different. (In truth what is different is that since the party has found the first Void Shard much sooner than Elminster did in the old timeline, Tannaeus and the Chronarch have started racing for the Void Shard from the Fire Plane much sooner, kickstarting this sequence of events much sooner than before)

## Bloodball Tournament
The Bloodball Tournament takes place in the days leading up to the Celebration of Life, with the final game being the day before the main party. If the party joins there would be 4 teams in the tournament, meaning the champion would need to win two games.

If the party joins the tournament, the first team they face would be a collection of local young adults calling themselves the Swamp Stompers. There team is made up of druid and spy stat blocks.

The second team is led by Idu the Bloodball champion. They call themselves Shkakethi (roughly translates to Killers). Idu has the champion stat block. The rest of his teammates have the swashbuckler stat block, except for one defender which has the Gladiator stat block and acts as a physical enforcer in defense.

### Bloodball Rules
Bloodball is similar to handball but with extreme violence. The game can be played with any number of players on a team, but they must be equal numbers. In terms of violence there are only two things not allowed: killing a player, and interacting with the goalie. The goalie is the only protected player.

When holding the ball, the ball carrier has two options. They can run with the ball, or throw it to a teammate. However, there is a semicircle zone around each team's goal that it is forbidden to step inside of.

A team scores by throwing the ball past the goalie and into the goal, which scores 1 point. The game is usually played to 5 points.
#### Mechanics
The game utilizes reactions a lot.
##### Running
A player carrying the ball can move with their movement speed while carrying the ball. If at any point they enter a square adjacent to a defender, that defender can use their reaction to attempt to steal the ball by initiating a contested athletics/acrobatics roll.
##### Passing
As an action, the ball carrier can attempt to pass the ball by making a ranged attack roll with the ball.

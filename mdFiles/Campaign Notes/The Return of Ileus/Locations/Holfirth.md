Population: 5,274 (55% Human, 30% Half-elf, 10% Elf, 5% other races)

Government: Lord Conrad Pixton (Human Male) works alongside Overseer Dara Erneth (Elf Female) to keep the town profitable and orderly.
Defense: The town boasts a white stone brick palisade that surrounds it. This protects mostly against the various monsters that live in the surrounding forest. Most of the town guards are only part-time guards employed by the Overseer. The part-time guards are often monster hunters who work as guards to generate a steadier income.
Commerce: Most basic goods and services are available here. Traders come from all across the empire to trade for and purchase exotic monster goods as well as more common monster goods from creatures that are bred here.
Organizations: There are temples and shrines to multiple gods in Holfirth, but the main god that is worshipped is Balinor. The Hunter's League employs a large number of townsfolk, along with the Beastkeep.

The land that Holfirth occupies was originally settled around 1450 PD and was named Holfirth in 1510 PD when the Larenthian Alliance incorporated it into the Federation. The name is derived from different words meaning forest. When the town was renamed upon incorporation, the natives described the location as Holt, meaning forest. So the new name became Holfirth, meaning "forest forest". The town is situated in the middle of the Shadowwood Forest on a large swath of land cleared from the forest next to a small lake. The lake is known as the Eldermere. Holfirth originated as a small trading post for hunters that operated in the Shadowwood Forest, and soon grew to be a booming central trade crossroads.

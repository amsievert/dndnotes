Owlbear Enclave is built around a small babbling brook that runs from a spring in a nearby hillside. The brook is used for a few mills in town, as well as to drive machines that assist in the stripping of Owlbear pelts for feathers, and the harvesting of Owlbear talons. Master Harvester Bob Biggum extracts the livers of the harvested Owlbears. These are most often used in Alchemy, and such most are shipped off to Wizendell. Most of the buildings in the village are built in a very medieval European style, but with many different colors, more like some Scandinavian towns. The mayor's name is Jiri Lanorys. She is a Tiefling from No'zaral. She came here because her family of scribes was disgraced and banished from the land for disobeying a noble's orders. She found her way here and soon became the mayor because of her learned nature. She is hopelessly oblivious but can have moments of genius. The overseer of the town is Iolis Batira, a half-elf man who is incredibly boring and mundane. He is just here to do his job and get paid, nothing else.

Entrance:
The dungeon entrance is a massive, ornate, sun-shaped door that only opens when a group of adventurers stands before it and speaks a prayer to Valos. The door then radiates with blinding light and reveals the path inside.

Room 1:
Dawn's Embrace:

Upon entering, the adventurers find themselves in a chamber painted in vibrant shades of orange and gold. A warm, radiant light fills the room, simulating a sunrise. To proceed, they must align a set of gemstones in the shape of a sun to mimic the actual position of the sun at dawn.

Room 2:
Chamber of Illumination:

A room bathed in bright sunlight where the walls are adorned with intricate solar motifs.

Challenge: Solve a light-based puzzle by manipulating mirrors and crystals to unlock the next chamber.

Room 3:
Flames of Devotion

In this chamber, the temperature rises significantly. Players must find a way to extinguish magical flames blocking their path by performing an act of devotion to Valos, such as reciting a prayer or offering a valuable item.

Room 4:
In this chamber, there are a bunch of illusory doors and one real door. Choosing an incorrect door causes an animated armor to attack the party. The correct door can be determined by answering a riddle that is inscribed onto the ground.

I'm nothing but the absence of light,
Yet in the darkest corners, I take flight.
What am I, that seems to disappear,
When you bring illumination near?

Answer: Shadow

Room 5:
In the final room is the altar which has an artifact on it. There are gold goblets, plates , and gems around the sides of the room. Touching the treasure burns the hand that touches it. On the wall is a mural that depicts someone wearing armor with light rays shooting out in all directions and blinding enemies attacking. One of the light rays leads toward the altar. Another points towards an inscription on the opposing wall. The inscription says, "May Valos bless his armor. Through the power of the nexus he shall conquer all."

The Solar Nexus was both a temple and a place of research for the people of the Helvalic Dominion. Priests and scholars searched for ways to heal the sick, predict the future, and craft divine wonders. The nexus today contains statues, altars, and temples dedicated to Valos, as well as libraries of books, tomes, and scrolls about the Helvalic peoples' findings. Valos lives on the plane of Arborea. The researchers and priests were searching for a way to commune directly with him. They were doing this by trying to create a teleporting circle to the plane. The term nexus refers to the fact that the temple was built on an area that was known to have planar anomalies that resulted in crossing of the material plane and arborea. In the final room of the Solar Nexus, there is a boss fight against a creature from Arborea. Sphinxes are known to live in Arborea, so there are riddles throughout the temple.

The Nexus is shaped like a large pyramid/ziggurat. The top of the Ziggurat is where the entrance is. The top chamber of the nexus is a cube room. There is a door on each side of the cube. Each door has a sun-shaped stone button in the center of it. All four buttons need to be pressed at the same time to open.

Room 1:
Room with large circle on the ground. The circle is a representation of the great wheel of cosmology. Each of the outer planes is represented by just its symbol. Stepping on any of the planes other than Arborea summons a hostile creature from that plane. When Arborea is stepped on, the symbol depresses into the ground and the whole wheel begins descending like an elevator to the next room.

Room 2:
This room is just an info dump mostly. There are a lot of broken shelves with books scattered around. Most of the books have decayed beyond legibility. There is a broken crystal ball on the ground. There are notes about how this area is a ley line in the planar fabric and how the weave here is unstable. It talks very briefly about how the sages here were trying to make a portal to Arborea. There is a page containing an entry or two from the Diary of Ileus.

Room 3:
This room is a large circle. In the center, is a small teleportation circle with runes carved into the ground. Around the circle are desks, viewing chairs, and some small wooden shields that are set up to hide behind from the teleportation circle. In the room currently are 2 Will o' Wisps that are looking to consume life.

Room 4:
This room is very ceremoniously decorated with a large carving of the front of a sphinx looming over one side of the room. In between its legs is a stone door. Upon approaching, the head of the sphinx turns down towards the party and begins speaking. It introduces itself as Estelios, Keeper of the Gates. In order to pass, Estelios explains that the party must answer three riddles, as well as promise to take nothing from further within.

Hallway:
On the way to room 5, there is what looks to be a 10 foot gap over a pit with spikes. Upon jumping across, the ground on the other side is revealed to be an illusion, and the real pit is actually 20 feet across. Falling in the spikes results in taking 2d10 piercing damage, and at the start of every consequent round, another 1d8 piercing.

Room 5:
This room is a teleportation hub. In the middle is a large runic carving with remnants of chalk dust on it. This is how high priests of Valos would travel between temples. The current room however is almost untraversable because of large, thick spider webs. Inside the room are 4 giant spiders.

Room 6:
This is the boss room. At the far side from the entrance is a broken planar gate. It looks to have been destroyed by some powerful outward force. Spattered across the room are swaths of different planes, plants, rock, and crystals of a nature that no one in the party has ever seen before. The room is a terrible smelling mix of many warring scents. The smell of sulfur and brimstone mixes with a sweet, honey-like smell as well as the smell of pine and fresh cut wood. The smell of copper weaves its way in between all of these. Standing in the middle is a large cyclops (it's slightly nerfed to be more fair). Behind him on the far side is a medium sized treasure heap, within which the armor of valos is scattered about. This room counts as a wild magic field, any magical abilities that are cast are accompanied by a roll on the wild magic surge table.

Aenaevi has his fight with Kardag. As soon as the fight is over, Kardag collects the armor and moves out to join the siege. When the party goes to get the ents, they find one named Treeman. He is reluctant to help because he is scared of the fire bringers. If Kardag loses, the rest of his warband leaves to go back to the siege. Upon hearing of his defeat, half of the siege force leaves. If the party somehow manages to retrieve the armor, they enter downtime during which they are contacted by Mage Ilixum, he wants to discuss the armor they collected.

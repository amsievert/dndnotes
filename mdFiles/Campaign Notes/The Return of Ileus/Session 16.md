Day: 12th of Aestia, 2519 PS

"As you approach the speckling of tents and fire pits, the scent of roasting meat fills your nostrils. You hear the din of wagons creaking as they pass and the shouting of different people advertising their goods. Situated at a corner of the two roads is a 3 story stone brick and wooden inn. A sign hangs out front that reads 'Blurn's Cairn'. Rising through the center of the roof is a tower of medium sized rocks that rises a few hundred feet in the air."

Blurn is a very large and very friendly firbolg with gray fur and short red puffy hair. If anyone asks him about the pile of rocks, the entire bar goes quiet and everyone turns to look at them. No one asks about that.

Blurn has a job for the party. He tells them that he has been waiting for a group of capable adventurers for a while now.

Blurn's friend Larold is a merchant from Rodigia. He always stops by Blurn's Rest after crossing the Eternal Scorch on his way to Galvenport. Last time he came through, he never came back from Galvenport. He came through with a shipment of Zephyr Armor from Rodigia. Nothing really seemed out of the ordinary with him. The one lead that Blurn has is that Larold liked to frequent the circus that performs out by the Crossroads.

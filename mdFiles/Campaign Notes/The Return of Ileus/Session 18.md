Galvenport Larold Quest:

Overview: Larold the Merchant travelled to Galvenport to deliver his shipment of Zephyr Armor. He was supposed to drop his shipment off at the Divinaire Academy Campus, but never made it there. His shipment was stopped by the Constabulary, and they sent for Head Archivist Mathias Ilacrous to inspect the magic items. He determined that they needed to be further tested at the Grand Archives. Before the shipment made it to the archives, it was again stolen, and Larold disappeared. The official account is that Larold ran off with the goods, but in reality, Ilacrous hired some goons to stage a theft so that Ilacrous could turn the goods into Ileus's Simulacrum, Cavius.
The main enemy of this part of the campaign is Ileus's Simulacrum or Simulacrums I don't know if there's gonna be multiple or not yet.

Important People: Larold was supposed to meet with Bingle McMahon, the shipping manager at the Divinaire Campus.
Ileus's Simulacrum uses disguise self and goes by the name Cavius.
Larold's emerald earing is actually a sending stone with the other side connected to

Exploration Notes
Temple of Mortessa:
Head Priestess: Raven Queen Nantoth
Preacher: Soul Speaker Planestrider
Description: The temple is made of black stone bricks and is built in a heavy gothic style. In the middle of the congregation hall, there is a large golden scale. All over the cathedral are gargoyles that are shaped like ravens.

The Arm Bar:
Bartender/Owner: Slum Glumby (Large Tortle who speaks and moves very slowly)
The main part of the bar is a viewing/lounge area surrounding a gravel pit in the middle, where fights happen and bets are placed. The fights are to submission and not to death. Despite this, there are nearly no rules in the fights, the no killing is more enforced by the actual fighters.
The champion fighter of the pit is a Githzerai Monk (Githzerai Zerth) named K'lish Targoth.

The Jewel Casino:

Games to play: 3 die divination, Fiendish Fortune, and regular Blackjack.
The Casino is owned by someone known as the Patrician. No one knows who he really is, but no one dares to cross him because anyone who does is never heard from again.
In the actual Casino, illusory spells make the walls and ceilings seem mystical and fill the air with mystical lights and flashes and sounds. Some of the dealers and bartenders cast suggestion or command or friends on the players to convince them to drink more or gamble more.
There is an underground club under the Casino named The Tomb, where people go fucking hard. People do hard drugs here, the music is bussin, and it is invite only and super exclusive. The main event at this club for the week is Bug Man Jones, a thri kreen who uses all of his hands to use like 6 different turntables.
There are various drinks to be bought in the casino, one of which enhances a players luck and essentially grants them one luck point to use during gambling, which can be used to reroll a die or get a new card in a card game
Another drink gives the consumer expertise on charisma checks for 10 minutes.
The bartenders also sell a drink that casts the modify memory on the drinker so that they can forget their losses of the night.

Constabulary Building:
Located inside the inner locks and backed up against the inner wall. The building is a large brick building built out of the same stone as the city walls. Inside 2 large double doors is a small waiting room with an aarokocra woman sitting behind a desk. Behind the desk is an open doorway that leads to the rest of the building (which is pretty much modeled after a police station). On the upper floor of the station is the detective offices, this is where Detective Thessa works. He's a satyr who was responsible for investigating the Larold case. In the basement of the office is the archives, where Larold's file is.

The file describes how Mathias Ilacrous told the Constabulary to keep a look out for a merchant carrying a shipment of magical armor. Once Detective Thessa and the Constabulary stopped Larold and sent for Ilacrous. The file details how the shipment was sent to the Grand Archives, but was robbed on the way there, and the shipment was stolen. Then on this page there is a note from the head Constable that says to report officially that Larold ran off with it to save face with Ilacrous.

When approached, the aarokocra woman asks if they have a crime to report or if they're here to bail someone out. The party is for sure not able to access the rest of the station without a very good reason. In the lobby there is also a security guard.

Treasury:
The treasury runs very similarly to a bank. The treasury building is a 4 story building located in the block of houses between the west Inner Locks gate and the port. The upper two stories have large bay windows all around. There's a line of tellers at the in the main lobby of the first floor, which is taller than the other floors. The other 3 floors are all offices for the bank workers and for the Federation Treasury people. On the first floor there is also a large 10 foot diameter vault that leads underground. The vault is heavily guarded.

On the 4th floor is a fancy office with a large window overlooking the port. This office belongs to Councilman Gerald Shaffer. He is also the Treasurer of the Larenthian Federation. Everything in his office is normal and not incriminating. There are lots of letters from Supreme Overseer Helga Lawbringer, talking about organizing the collection of taxes from the cities of the Alliance. There are lots of tax documents about the office.

Upon a DC 18 investigation check, a character can find a hidden compartment that contains documents from Cavius, the Simulacrum. There are letters threatening Shaffer's family and his position on the Chief's Council and telling him to withhold the funds from Holfirth until the siege is complete.

Faerie's Wing Epidemic:
Starting while the party is investigating the Larold case and the money case, a Wing epidemic is brewing. Wing is a new drug just hitting the market, and people aren't used to its effect yet. There is a mysterious phenomenon starting of people walking off of roofs and dying with no explanation. No one knows why it is happening.

The drug begins circulating in the Underguild, and eventually starts hitting the Tomb as well. However, most of the drug use in the Tomb is still Dragon Dust and Medusa's Glare.

Someone that the party knows is going to die from Wing but I don't know who yet.

Drugs:
- Efreeti Essence:
	- Sold in small glass jars. Inside the jar is a magical swirling essence. To take, the user opens the jar and inhales the essence. This drug gives the user advantage on perception checks and 8 temp hp, but prolonged use can induce madness. Withdrawal symptoms also include irritability, exhaustion, and madness as well.

- Medusa's Glare:
	- Sold in small capsules, two capsules equate to one dose. The drug is taken by squeezing the capsules out into one's eyes. The drug paralyzes the consumer but gives them vivid daydreams and hallucinations. The daydreams and hallucinations are extremely pleasant and calming, or even nostalgic. This drug is very addictive, and constant abuse will turn the user into stone. Withdrawal symptoms include extreme mood swings and depression. Everything starts to look less colorful and vivid. The sufferer also has a harder time concentrating on tasks (including spells).

- Dragon Dust:
	- Essentially molly/ecstasy. It is a dust that is sold in a small box and then snorted from the box. The user enters a euphoric and lustful state. They act similar to if they've taken a philter of love, but with everyone. Everything seems more vibrant and the user becomes flooded with intense happiness and emotion. The user gains advantage on charisma checks for 4 hours, but then has disadvantage on charisma checks for the next day.

- Faerie's Wing:
	- This drug is a small dried out tab that is placed on the tongue. When taken, it makes the user feel happy, carefree, joyful, and light as air. It gives the user the effect of the Featherfall spell for 30 minutes. However, the user feels as if they have feather fall for around 2 hours.

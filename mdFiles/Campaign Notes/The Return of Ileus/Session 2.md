Day: 22nd of Florum, 2519 PS

Activites for after the battle is over:

✔Three wolves escaped from the Wolf Pens, heading south, the party will be paid 75 gp per wolf retrieved alive, or 40 gp per wolf dead.

❌All of the stagecoaches have been broken in the raid. The party will be paid 25 gp to fix them. If they can't fix them themselves, a master tinkerer lives just north of the village. His house is a very intricately carved wooden cabin. His name is Cedric Fritz. He estimates that it will cost him 50 gp for materials and labor. His wants are that he wants to be left alone and doesn't want to be involved with woodworking any more, since he is retired. He can be persuaded with ideas of this job convincing the town to leave him alone.

✔ Mayor Graumil asks if the party would please clean up the dead bodies around town. The remaining guards will help but there aren't many left. He can only afford to pay 25 gp for this.

✔Bert at the tavern tells the party that giant rats have invaded his cellar since the raiders spilled his grain and alcohol all over.

Nok at the Archives wants to know why the goblins attacked and went for the archives. If the goblins got to the archives and escaped, they stole information about the Helvalic Dominion. If not, the hobgoblin captain has information on him telling him to steal things related to the Helvalic Dominion. If the information is in the library, it points the party towards the ruins by owlbear enclave. If the information is stolen, the party must track the goblins back to their camp.

When the party decides to head toward Owlbear Enclave, they can choose their mode of transportation. Walking and riding horses takes the same amount of time. They can pay a discounted price for a stagecoach ride there. About 4 miles out of town, goblins and hobgoblins with green cloths sewn into their armor and clothing ambush the party. The green cloths look the same as the ones from the village raiders. They are looking for books about the Helvalic Dominion. The men they sent to get the books never returned, so they're checking people leaving the village now. The boss asks if the party has any books of the like. If the party says no, the boss asks if the party wouldn't mind the goblins searching their belongings then since they don’t have it. He gives them his word that they won't take anything. If he finds the books on them, he is disappointed and tells the party off, saying that the people he work for will not show the mercy he is if they are found looking more into the Helvalic Dominion. If he doesn't find the books, then he lets them pass with no problems.

About another 5 miles later, the party hears some growling in the brush to the side of the trail. It is an owlbear looking for food. It doesn't want to attack but it will if it is threatened.

A few miles out of town, the party finds a small grave site belonging to a warrior from the Helvalic Dominion.

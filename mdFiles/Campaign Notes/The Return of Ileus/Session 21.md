Day: 2nd of Calo, 2519 PS

The battle with Lilac and the Violet Horde commences.

The Real Cavius:
The real Cavius is dumbfounded by the discovery of the other Cavius. He asserts that he knows nothing about this plot and the other Cavius. He says that he is a famous archmage and it is possible that someone is taking on the façade of him.

Gerald Shaffer:
A middle aged half-elf with a receding hairline and black hair with gray creeping into it. He has a light stubble and a tired voice. He is open to work with the party, if they can convince him that they are capable adventurers. Shaffer stresses that if the party is caught, his family will probably die. Shaffer also knows more about Cavius II. He knows that Cavius II started showing up in the government about a year ago. He knows that Cavius II is good friends with the king.

Shaffer says that the first thing that the party can do to prove their worth is by infiltrating one of Cavius's warehouses at the docks. The warehouse is in an unseeming area. However, inside there are many thugs. Shaffer has no idea what's in the warehouse, but he thinks there could be more about Cavius II's whereabouts or other doings. He says to not be afraid of killing the thugs, because they are employed by Cavius II who doesn't want to have evidence of his deeds, so the thug deaths will be covered up by him.

As soon as the thugs start getting attacked, one of them near the office runs to send warning to Cavius II, who can teleport to the warehouse via a teleportation circle in the office. After the warning is sent, Cavius appears in 2 turns. Cavius II notes:

Working with the Underguild:
The Underguild can be interfaced with through The Tomb. Down here, there is a special room with some gambling tables. At a table in its own suite, the Patrician plays Fiendish Fortune. If the players beat everyone in the normal room, they can gain an audience with the Patrician. He is sympathetic to the party's cause, saying that he is always down to cause some mayhem within the government and mess with them.

He says that if they want, he knows of a hideout of a gang called the Violet Horde that is working with someone in the government (These are the goons that were hired by Cavius II to steal Larold's shipment). Their hideout is in an abandoned clocktower in the housing district near the east wall. The clocktower was abandoned many years ago, but is still standing today. Parts of the outer façade are crumbling away and the hands of clock face hang dormant. The tower itself is about ten stories tall, allowing for a good view from far off. The first floor has a single wooden door that is locked.

Upon reaching the top and dealing with everyone up there, along with the treasure horde, the group also finds Larold's Emerald Earing (Which is actually a sending stone). There's also letters from Cavius II telling the Violet Horde to ambush Larold's delivery on the way to the Grand Archives. It also says to deliver the merchant (Larold) to the docks warehouse at (insert address, this is also the warehouse that Gerald Shaffer knows about).

Cavius II notes:
Cavius II takes the visage of his master Ileus as he was when during the height of the dissension. He has a long brown beard with some silver streaks in it. He wears a long, elegant purple robe (robe of the archmagi) and pointy wizard hat. He carries a golden staff, twisted at the top to cradle a small glowing purple crystal (Staff of the Magi) too. (Mechanically, Cavius II doesn't have these items, but Ileus does).

Under the brim of the hat one can see Cavius II has pale skin, with a purple glowing arcane scar leading up to his right eye, which itself is deep purple nearly black for the white part and has a piercing white pupil. He speaks in a typical rp accent. He is also somewhat arrogant as well as extremely confident in his ability.

When he appears in the Warehouse, he is initially ready to fight, but upon seeing the party, Ileus takes over and urges everyone to stop fighting. He comments on how nice it is to finally meet the heroes of Holfirth. His goal of the meeting is to tell the party to stay out of his business, which if they can't do, he will not hesitate to destroy them and everything they care about. He tells them that he's no different than any other politician, just trying to play the power game. He advises the party that if they feel like they can't stay out of his affairs, they are welcome to leave the city.

Violet Horde Lair/Dungeon:
The single wooden door is surprisingly hard to open. It requires a DC 20 lockpicking check. However, the door itself isn't the most sturdy, and 10 damage to it, or a strength check with a DC equal to its AC, will break it down. The door is trapped however, and if not caught, a dagger attached to a lever arm swings down from above and deals the opener of the door piercing damage. The trap is activated by a string that is attached to the inside of the door frame and the top corner of the door away from the hinge. When the string pulls taught, the trap is activated. Opening the door a little bit doesn't activate the trap, only opening it considerably does.

Inside the door is a hallway that leads to a spiral staircase up the middle of the clocktower. On either side of the hallway are doors that lead into other rooms around the bottom of the tower. These rooms are basic sleeping quarters and barracks for the members of the gang. If it's night time, there are 3 bandits and 1 thug sleeping in each room. Looting the thugs and their small chests yields:

| Rug Room     | 15cp, 20sp, 8gp, 1pp |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| Oval Table   | 14cp, 29sp, 12gp     |
| Curtains     | 33cp, 25sp           |
| Square Table | 45cp, 5gp            |

The only actual floors in this tower are the first floor and the top floor with the clock face. While going up the stairs, the first few floors are surrounded by stone. At the fifth floor, the stone gives way and the stairs rise through the interior gears of the clock. Around the third floor, a DC 18 investigation check reveals that one of the steps has no foot traffic on it. If stepped on, the step depresses like a pressure plate and three darts shoot through an illusory brick in the wall. Each dart deals 1d6 poison damage and requires a DC 10 constitution saving throw to resist becoming poisoned for an hour.

On the top floor is the gang leader, whose name is Lilac, a large female half-orc. There are also 4 spies, 2 on each elevated surface, and 6 thugs, 2 on the main area and 2 on each side area. Lilac's desk sits with its back to the large clock face. There is a large chest to the left of the desk. Upon looting the area, one can find:

| Money       | 700cp, 11,000sp, 1700gp, 80pp                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Art Objects | 2 250 gp objects: Large gold-embroidered tapestry, box of turquoise animal figurines |
| Magic Items | Rope of Climbing, Helm of Comprehend Languages                                       |

More Cavius Notes:

"Cavius II" is what I'm calling Ileus's simulacrum that is terrorizing Galvenport. The mechanics behind the simulacrum work slightly different than an actual simulacrum. This modified simulacrum has been modified by Ileus since he is an Ancient Archmage and literally played a part in creating the Illusion school of magic. Ileus gave the simulacrum the name "Cavius" after his apprentice from long ago. Ileus is not aware that the real Cavius's soul lives on in the Ring of Mind Shielding. Cavius II is slightly different from a normal simulacrum in the sense that he regenerates spell slots like a normal character, and can heal himself using the gold to hit point exchange of a normal simulacrum. If killed, he will turn to snow and ash just like a normal simulacrum. Ileus imbued Cavius II with an exact replica of his mind, so Cavius II and Ileus share the exact same personality. Because of this mental link, Ileus is able to remotely take control of Cavius II if he chooses.

Cavius II, acting mostly of his own accord, has infiltrated deep into the Larenthian Government. Through deception, blackmail, and manipulation, he has gotten into a spot where he is trusted by some people in the government, and under the table he is also blackmailing people into doing his dirty work. Chief Alfir trusts him a lot, as does Dormar Talovol, the head diviner of the alliance and the headmaster of the Divinaire Institute.

Cavius II has been infiltrating the Larenthian government for around a year now, and people in the government know about him, but he isn't on any official government records. He doesn't hold an official position of power, and some people think he is just a rumor. He is very much real though, and is arguably more influential than the Chief, at least in Galvenport politics.

He lives in a secret room in the grand study of the Platinum Palace, given to him by Chief Alfir. Alfir himself is very secretive about his relationship with Cavius II.

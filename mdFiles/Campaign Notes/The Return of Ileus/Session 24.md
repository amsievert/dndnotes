Day: 22nd of Calo, 2519 PS

Serpent's Pass: In serpent's pass, about halfway down, a huge, 300 foot long purple worm skeleton can be found. The path goes straight through its ribcage.

After the serpent skeleton, the party is attacked by the bandit's that attacked the other caravan. A bunch of halfling bandits attack from the hills.

At the branded pass, there is a Larenthian border checkpoint. They bid the party safe travels and tell them to stop at the Qazide Trading Post if they need supplies.

If anyone is out in the sun and does not have a headwrap on, they must make a DC 10 constitution saving throw at the beginning of each day. On a fail, they take a point of exhaustion.

A few hours outside of the trading post, the party finds an oasis about 20 feet on each side. There are some trees and a small pond. Buried at the bottom of the pond is a 10 foot tall metal breastplate with a symbol that looks like a circle with three lines coming off the top. This is the symbol of Libai.

There are two paths through the eastern scorch. One cuts towards the center and heads through the Kha'anj Oasis. The other path bypasses the Oasis and heads directly south. The bypass is much quicker, but it isn't as safe because it is farther from civilization, and it heads past Jorfiin.

Kha'anj
Population: 10,256 (89% Goblinoids, 5% Humans, 5% Elves/Half-Elves, 1% Other)

Government: An oligarchy known as the Sayid Alma runs the oasis. There are 4 Sayids that make up the Sayid Alma. They enforce their strict policies via the Ma'himat, the city guards. The Sayid Alma mostly deals with issues of trade and punishment. The capitol building of Kha'anj is called the Castle of Brass. It is in the middle of the oasis, overlooking the main body of water, the Water of Life (Ma' Alhaya).

Lore: The Oasis was formed during the Battle of the Planes, when Libai had her hand chopped off. It fell to the ground and from it, the Oasis blossomed. The Water of Life in the middle is said to be the blood that pooled from the lost hand. The Sayid Alma took over the Oasis around 2450 PS, roughly 75 years ago. Before them, the Oasis was a much smaller settlement, called the Wahatan Oasis. It served as a safe stop for travellers and had no real government. Permanent settlement began with the Wahatan Era only around 2300 PS.

Kha'anj Quests:
The party comes across someone from the Skrekin Traditionalists. She explains to them what the group is about and asks them to help with a quest. There was a group exploring a Sandsail ruin out to the west. They lost contact a few days ago and need someone to go check it out.

Everyone in the camp is either missing or dead and a horde of mummies and zombies has taken their place. Through investigation, the party can find a manual with drawings descibing how to craft a Sandsail and another journal scrap that looks really old. It describes how to cast a spell that creates water. Mechanically it is just a scroll of create food and water.

The Water of Life glows a faint emerald green at night. Some say that it is because the water has ancient healing properties. Others think it was contaminated by the Skrekin people. Yet others think that there is a portal to another plane at the bottom. This is actually true. There is a plane at the bottom of the Water that leads to The Beastlands. This portal was created by the Skrekin scholars in an experiment in extraplanar travel.

Â If the party gets along with the Skrekin Traditionalists, they can take up another mission. Jerg Jag is secretly a Traditionalist and needs help faking his death. They ask the party to help come up with the scenario.

Day: 28th of Calo, 2519 PS

2 days outside of Kha'anj, a giant sandstorm approaches from the west. There are a few matwah or some Sandsail wrecks to take shelter in.

To the South of Kha'anj, there is a massive rocky mountain. The local myths claim that this mountain is actually Ka'Natel, a primordial from the elemental plane of earth. She is called the mother of all earth elementals. The story goes that she was summoned by Terra during the Battle of the Planes and was felled. It is said that when she rises again, she will bless those who respect the desert with great power.

There are two paths through the eastern scorch. One cuts towards the center and heads through the Kha'anj Oasis. The other path bypasses the Oasis and heads directly south. The bypass is much quicker, but it isn't as safe because it is farther from civilization, and it heads past Jorfiin.

Kha'anj
Population: 10,256 (89% Goblinoids, 5% Humans, 5% Elves/Half-Elves, 1% Other)

Government: An oligarchy known as the Sayid Alma runs the oasis. There are 4 Sayids that make up the Sayid Alma. They enforce their strict policies via the Ma'himat, the city guards. The Sayid Alma mostly deals with issues of trade and punishment. The capitol building of Kha'anj is called the Castle of Brass. It is in the middle of the oasis, overlooking the main body of water, the Water of Life (Ma' Alhaya).

Lore: The Oasis was formed during the Battle of the Planes, when Libai had her hand chopped off. It fell to the ground and from it, the Oasis blossomed. The Water of Life in the middle is said to be the blood that pooled from the lost hand. The Sayid Alma took over the Oasis around 2450 PS, roughly 75 years ago. Before them, the Oasis was a much smaller settlement, called the Wahatan Oasis. It served as a safe stop for travellers and had no real government. Permanent settlement began with the Wahatan Era only around 2300 PS.

While in the city, the party is approached by a mean-looking female goblin named Maggie. She calls Saraq "Saghir" and warns him that the Tilktan are looking for him and that they want blood. She tells him that if the tribe didn't catch him coming in, they must have moved south.

Maggie doesn't know the rest of the story which is: The Tak family (The other fighting family from the Tilktan Tribe) has essentially taken over the tribe. Since Saraq and his brother were his mother's only children, they were the only heirs to her position. The leader of the Tak family, Clargg, offered up one of his sons, Nabim, to be the next heir. Saraq's mother, Akima, was opposed to this and made it known that she would never let this happen. A few years after Saraq's banishment, his mother mysteriously disappeared while traveling one day, and Nabim took her spot, with Clargg intimidating anyone who tried to say otherwise. Saraq was presumed to be dead after his banishment, but since he was spotted returning to the desert, the Tilktan, led by Clargg and Nabim, have been trying to hunt him down and kill him to secure their rule.

Kha'anj Quests:
The party comes across someone from the Skrekin Traditionalists. She explains to them what the group is about and asks them to help with a quest. There was a group exploring a Sandsail ruin out to the west. They lost contact a few days ago and need someone to go check it out.

Everyone in the camp is either missing or dead and a horde of mummies and zombies has taken their place. Through investigation, the party can find a manual with drawings descibing how to craft a Sandsail and another journal scrap that looks really old. It describes how to cast a spell that creates water. Mechanically it is just a scroll of create food and water.

The Water of Life glows a faint emerald green at night. Some say that it is because the water has ancient healing properties. Others think it was contaminated by the Skrekin people. Yet others think that there is a portal to another plane at the bottom. This is actually true. There is a plane at the bottom of the Water that leads to The Beastlands. This portal was created by the Skrekin scholars in an experiment in extraplanar travel.

Â If the party gets along with the Skrekin Traditionalists, they can take up another mission. Jerg Jag is secretly a Traditionalist and needs help faking his death. They ask the party to help come up with the scenario.

Day: 17th of Ignus, 2519 PS

While in the city, the party is approached by a mean-looking female goblin named Maggie. She calls Saraq "Saghir" and warns him that the Tilktan are looking for him and that they want blood. She tells him that if the tribe didn't catch him coming in, they must have moved south.

Maggie doesn't know the rest of the story which is: The Tak family (The other fighting family from the Tilktan Tribe) has essentially taken over the tribe. Since Saraq and his brother were his mother's only children, they were the only heirs to her position. The leader of the Tak family, Clargg, offered up one of his sons, Nabim, to be the next heir. Saraq's mother, Akima, was opposed to this and made it known that she would never let this happen. A few years after Saraq's banishment, his mother mysteriously disappeared while traveling one day, and Nabim took her spot, with Clargg intimidating anyone who tried to say otherwise. Saraq was presumed to be dead after his banishment, but since he was spotted returning to the desert, the Tilktan, led by Clargg and Nabim, have been trying to hunt him down and kill him to secure their rule.

As the party leaves the Oasis and heads to Falstor, they might notice that there are groups of 2 following the party. After a day or two, the party is set upon by a group of bandits sledding down one of the dunes. There are 10 bandits in total (2 Mages, 1 Master Thief, 4 Archers, and 3 Veterans). The Mage has the following spells prepared: Fire Bolt, Message, Minor Illusion, Light; Mage Armor, Shield, Sleep, Chromatic Orb; Hold Person, Suggestion; Sending, Fireball, Dispel Magic. The Master Thief is Nabim Tak, the heir to Akima's seat in the tribe leaders, and the son of Clargg Tak. His mission is to capture Saraq and bring him back to the Tilktan tribe so that he can face punishment for killing his brother during their coming of age mission.

This is not at all what actually happened, but after Saraq's banishment, Clargg began spreading the rumor that Saraq had killed his brother, Easifa, during the coming of age ritual and that the banishment was unrighteous and he should be killed instead. Nabim informs the rest of the party that they are welcome to leave but if they try to intervene they will also be captured and killed.

Clargg has the Champion stat block, but uses a one-handed longsword instead of a spear, and has +1 studded leather armor. If he is attacked outright, whoever remains from the ambush party joins the fight, or if they are all dead, 2 archers and 2 veterans join the fight.

Rodigia Encounters

After travelling through Rodigia for about a day, the party sees a giant elk standing on the path. Suddenly a large arrow flies from the brush and strikes the elk, killing it instantly. A stone giant walks out from the brush and begins field dressing the elk. Open for RP here. Eventually, a Rodigian Ranger approaches and begins scolding the giant hunter. Elk are endangered in this area, but the giant needs food because he's so big.

As the party reaches the top of a snowy summit, they pass by a small cavern opening. They hear a banging noise coming from inside. Inside, the cave is covered in glowing crystals of all colors. A frost giant with a pickaxe is breaking crystals off and collecting them in a large sack. He is skeptical of the party, and acts shifty, not explaining what the crystals are. In actuality, the crystals can be refined into pure Harmonium. Harmonium is the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. This can be a roleplay or combat encounter.

As the party traverses a valley, a Roc swoops down from the summits above, attacking the party. Once it becomes bloody, it retreats, and with a DC18 perception check, someone can spot a small rock outcropping where the Roc perches. On top of this outcropping, the Roc has a nest. Inside it is a large Roc egg, and a treasure hoard.

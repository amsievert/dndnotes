Day: Harvest Moon, 2519 PS

Dalonstor:
If Astarius truly makes his father proud, he will gift him his plate armor from when he was a fighter. This could happen maybe if Astarius faces the buffed Meridan Rocc and somehow survives.

The Harvest Moon festival takes place on the day of Harvest Moon after the 30th of Ignus. Meridan Rocc will be having a title fight on that day. Percival is able to slot Astarius in for a fight on this day.

Master Hewg forges a new longsword for Astarius. For the first 5 attacks that hit with the sword it deals an additional 2 points of damage.

The Meridan Rocc Conspiracy:

Meridan Rocc has the Gladiator stat block. However, along with the help of the hidden Rocc child Jess Rocc and the Night Stalkers, they have been sacrificing people to Artanor beneath the Rocc mansion and siphoning their life force to strengthen Meridan. They must do this every few days to keep the buff active. While buffed in this way, Meridan is resistant to all damage and heals 10hp per round. This conspiracy is the reason for the ongoing abductions by the Night Stalkers.

The Laboratory:
Hidden beneath the Rocc Manor, Jess Rocc's laboratory toils away. It is accessed by pulling a book labelled The Rituals of Artanor. A secret staircase opens up and leads down to the Lab. Jess Rocc works down there day and night, researching rituals to make Meridan stronger. There are a few people down in the Lab in cages, awaiting sacrifice. Jess Rocc has the [Cult Leader](https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/cult-leader-3pp/) stat block, and he has 4 cult fanatics that work with him.

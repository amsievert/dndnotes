Day: 20th of Otun, 2519 PS

Troubled Waters:
Since Reev Rocc got in power, the Rocc's fishing waters have slowly been expanding, taking over the waters of the other houses. Houses Mason and Pili are sequestered to tiny parts of Dalonstor's waters. House Alystri still has reasonable waters, but House Rocc is slowly claiming more and more. This normally wouldn't be allowed, but since Siobhan Rocc runs the Fishing Guild, she controls all documents of official fishing lands, and these conveniently change for House Rocc. Alystri fishing ships near the borders are being attacked and sunk by Rocc warships. The Alystris have lost 2 of their warships to the superior Rocc warships.

The Shipping Guild:
Robert Rocc of the Shipping Guild controls both the building of ships and the flow of goods in and out of Dalonstor. Robert Rocc is the least corrupt of the Steward's council. He allows trade to proceed naturally and doesn't interfere with it at all. He does however use the Shipping Guild's research team to develop new and stronger warships and keep the innovations within Rocc hands. This is why the Rocc warships are so superior to the other Houses'.

UPDATED Resources:
The Alystris have 4 warships (1 with 4 cannons instead of 2 mangonels and 1 captured Rocc Mangonel Warship at 1 HP) and 10 Keelboats (Fishing boats). The Roccs have 7 warships (4 with 4 cannons instead of 2 mangonels) and 30 Keelboats. All of the Rocc cannon warships have the Defiant Sails upgrade (All ranged attacks against the ships and crew are at disadvantage).

Execution Day:
The 20th of Otun is the day of Sylas's Execution. Out front of the Trench, there is a large venue set up where people can stand in a sort of town square and watch the gallows that are set up nearest to the arena. Reev and Sable conduct the ceremony, while Nightstalkers keep the peace.

Before the ceremony, Percival talks to the party, he tells Astarius that Balor wants to see him urgently in his recovery room. He then informs the rest of the party of some intel that he has come across: most of the nightstalkers are going to be at the execution ceremony, but Siobhan and Robert Rocc won't be. They will instead be continuing to work at the Rocc shipyard, which will have decreased security. If the party wants, they can either choose to try to save Sylas, or try to kill Siobhan and Robert.

The Army
The army of 45,000 marching through the desert will eventually reach Rodigia. From there they besiege Rhugnurt. While being a distraction for Ileus, all of the soldiers and commanders still believe that this is a real siege. Their goal is to sack the city in a show of power to intimidate the Mountain King into entering into a pact alliance with Larenthia, and to turn over all of Rodigia's key exports to Larenthian merchants to prevent another "attack".

Meanwhile, Ileus travels to Mount Smedr to retrieve the Hammer of Epius by himself.

Knoglir, the All-Knowing:
Deep beneath a mountain near Mount Smedr, an ancient emerald dragon named Knoglir, the All-Knowing. He hoards knowledge rather than treasure. He has been alive since before the Dissension, staying alive by mostly hiding beneath an Illusion in his mountain lair. However, he was friends with Epius the Archmage of Transmutation. Epius worked in the forge of Mount Smedr for a bit, and Knoglir became friends with him during that time. Knoglir learned a lot from Epius, keeping it all safe in his perfect memory. After the scourge, Knoglir made a deal with Uvira to keep an eye on Epius's forge. In his free time, Knoglir also began collecting knowledge on everything about the Dissension that he had not learned from Epius, this included information on the locations of the Relics of Dissension.

In the modern day, he knows the locations of all of the Relics or at least where the plot hook for each one is. He can be reasoned with by the party to get some of his knowledge.

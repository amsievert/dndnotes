Day: 3rd of Messime, 2519 PS

The Siege
The siege of Rhugnurt has been ongoing for about a tenday and a half. The Larenthian forces remain camped at the bottom of Mount Thogrin. Attempts to attack the city via the Winding Road have been completely unsuccessful, as it takes only a handful of giants to block the road. Every day, boulders are hurled off the top of Mount Thogrin and crash down onto the Larenthian Camp. Morale is running thin.

The leader of the Larenthian army is General Blaith Smil. He is a gruff half-orc who is surprisingly well-articulated. What he knows:
- A merchant from Rodigia attacked critical infrastructure in Galvenport
- The army's mission is to sack Rhugnurt to show strength and to force Rodigia into a one-sided trade subjugation
- Currently, the army is raiding hamlets in the nearby area to try and draw out an attack from the Rhugnurt garrison

Nearby, Ileus searches almost 24/7 for Epius's Workshop. He has narrowed his search down to the nearby volcano, Mount Smedr. The entrance to the workshop however has continuously eluded him.

This is due to the fact that the Workshop is not magically protected at all, so as not to be detected by a detect magic spell. There are 2 current ways into the workshop. The normal entrance was sealed off long ago and has been covered in volcanic ash for ages now. A very good investigation or nature check could find signs of an entrance being here. The other entrance is inside the mouth of the volcano, where an old exhaust duct exits. From the top ring of the volcano to the base of the mouth is about 500 feet. The entirety of the mouth is covered in bubbling lava, except for the small ventilation tube, which is about 3 feet in diameter. The tube is within jumping range of the lip of the volcano mouth, or one could try to traverse the lava.

Knoglir, the All-Knowing:
Deep beneath a mountain near Mount Smedr, an ancient emerald dragon named Knoglir, the All-Knowing. He hoards knowledge rather than treasure. He has been alive since before the Dissension, staying alive by mostly hiding beneath an Illusion in his mountain lair. However, he was friends with Epius the Archmage of Transmutation. Epius worked in the forge of Mount Smedr for a bit, and Knoglir became friends with him during that time. Knoglir learned a lot from Epius, keeping it all safe in his perfect memory. After the scourge, Knoglir made a deal with Uvira to keep an eye on Epius's forge. In his free time, Knoglir also began collecting knowledge on everything about the Dissension that he had not learned from Epius, this included information on the locations of the Relics of Dissension.

In the modern day, he knows the locations of all of the Relics or at least where the plot hook for each one is. He can be reasoned with by the party to get some of his knowledge.

Siege Camp
The siege camp at this point consists of about 35,000 soldiers (5,000 have died assaulting Rhugnurt so far). The general's tent is within a small palisade at the center of the large camp. The camp is surprisingly well kept, which upon closer inspection is because of a team of apprentice wizards that go around casting prestidigitation of everything.

There are big open wedding-style tents scattered throughout the camp where the quartermasters work. The quartermasters are all wizards, who use magic to create food and water for the soldiers.

Higher ranking soldiers patrol the camp, monitoring activity.

Every once in a while, a very high-ranking wizard walks through. The soldiers, even the high ranking ones, are scared of them. These wizards work directly with the general as part of a special operations team. Their tents are inside the inner palisade.

The wall of the inner palisade is made of large sharpened tree trunks stuck into the ground. It has one entrance, which is guarded by a few elite soldiers, who are specially trained to deal with magic users.

General Smil and his other lieutenants have a war room where they plan all of their operations. Currently they are working on three things. The first, they are searching for some sort of lift up the mountain. They figure that there must be some way for the giants to get large shipments up to the city without taking the winding road. The second, they are trying to find a way to possibly attack from above via some sort of flying technology. The third, they are brainstorming ways to attack from the winding road without taking the heavy casualties that they already have.

General Smil and his closest lieutenants are the only ones that know that Cavius/Ileus came along with the army. He has been helping slightly via sending spells, but beyond that they have no idea what he is doing, only that he headed out towards Mount Smedr.

Epius's Workshop
The entrance has been covered by a large landslide of boulders, and then covered in ash by the volcano outside. The entrance room is a large hall with statues of giants holding various smithing tools and weapons. Scattered about the room are skeletons of giants and a few humanoid mages that died during the attack long ago. Torches illuminate as the party walk further down the room. At the end is an arched doorway that leads further into the workshop.

The second room is a storage area. There are crates of raw materials, old wagons and a maze of chests, crates, and crude conveyor belts. Touching any of the weapons causes it to glow hot red and burn the character's hand for 1d6 fire damage.

The next room is a big smithing room. There is a stone golem walking around, which alert when they see the party and attack on sight.

The next room is circular in shape, with a large stalactite hanging from the ceiling. This large rock has red veins on it that seem to be pulsing and glowing red. Around the room are various statues of giants and mages alike. They are all looking at the glowing rock with terrified expressions. When one of their lines of sights are broken, they become unfrozen from the stone and fall to the ground dead. One of the giants has a key around its neck that can only be retrieved once unfrozen.

The next room has the primordial core. There are 2 fire elemental myrmidons here.

The last room has the hammer of epius guarded by 4 helmed horrors.

The workshop lore:
Mount Smedr has a magical core at the center of it. The core is a part of a primordial fire elemental. The lava in the workshop closer to the center sometimes spawns lava elementals, which required systems to keep under control. During the Arcane Resurgence, mages attacked the workshop, attempting to steal the core. Throughout the workshop, there are remnants of this ancient battle, which would have happened around 700 PS.

The giants should have more guards at the lift if encountered again

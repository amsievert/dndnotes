Day: 26th of Messime, 2519 PS

Elysium:
Going through the High Priest's gate transports the party to the portal room of the Golden Hearth. There are many deactivated portals in this room. As the party comes through the portal, guardinals descend on them. They are quickly dispersed however by a small halfling man that chides them and introduces himself as Master Chorns. He is the head servant of the Golden Hearth. He assumes that one of the party members is the head priest since they've used the head priest's portal.

He can give the party a quick rundown of the palace and take them to the throne room.

As long as Cielia isn't too mad, she will allow the party to use one of her ships. It is a Sailing Ship with a reinforced hull, defiant sails, and arcane artillery cannons.

Elysium Encounters:
Sailing on a small raft is a well-groomed man. He seems completely oblivious to the gravity of his situations of being lost at sea. His name is Arlen. He remembers sailing on the Azure Expanse and then suddenly he was here. What he doesn't know is that he is actually dead.

If the party decides to stop at any of the islands, they stop at the island of Ilothar Ilbrie, the mage who sacrificed himself to seal the final rift using the Aegis of the Veil during the Battle of Limmedorn's Rift during the Astral Devastation. He is really enjoying his time in Elysium and is happy to talk about the Resurgence. He was a Kainomancer and he was one of the original mages from Spellhaven that resurrected Naivara. His group traveled through one of the rifts to get behind enemy lines and traveled to the edges of the Astral Plane to find Naivara's soul.

After a few days, a solar flies down from the sky and lands on the boat. He warns the party that the Thalastrom is in the direction that they are heading and advises them to divert course.

If the party chooses to go around the Thalastrom, it adds a few days to their travel. In the distance, they can see the Thalastrom ravaging through the ocean. It destroys everything in its path, including entire islands. They also see Solars and Guardinals flying around inside the storm battling Krakens and Sahuagins.

If the party decides to travel through the storm, they get involved in a fight between a kraken and a solar.

After these encounters, the party reaches Esemaryl's island, which is known as Evoker's Embrace.

Evoker's Embrace:
Esemaryl's island is a lush tropical island. It's made up of short, sparse poplar trees surrounded by calm, white sand beaches. In the middle of the small island, a cylindrical tower spirals into the sky, crooked in seemingly impossible places.

There is a wooden door at the bottom of the tower and a window at the very top of the tower. There is also a strange crystal attached to the top that prevents teleportation into or out of the tower. The window at the top has a 6th level fireball stored in a glyph of warding. The front door has a small ornate knocker in the middle and is locked. A sign on the door says: "In this house, we are *Courteous*". If the players try to pick the lock or knock down the door, a glyph activates, shocking the player for 1d10 lightning damage. The door can be opened by simply knocking.

Inside the first floor is a fairly ornate living/dining room. Animated brooms move around slowly, keeping the place free from dust.

The second floor is a long decayed alchemy set. There are a few empty bowls and vials but nothing more.

The third floor has a desecrated healing circle. There are four wraiths in this room, they attack the party, trying to kill them and raise them as specters.

The fourth floor is the penultimate floor. This one is half storage and half enchanting room. In the storage part there is spell paper and ink. There are also scrolls. Throughout the room are scrolls of jump, thunderwave, darkness, stinking cloud, and ice storm. There is also a mirror that is covered with a blanket. On the blanket is an illusory script that says "DO NOT TOUCH".

The door to the top floor where the study is is locked with a combination lock. In the room is a note that says: Code contains 0, 3, 4, 5, 8. 4 is to the right of 5, but not necessarily adjacent. 0 and 5 keep a maximum distance. The two digits on the right add up to the same number as the two digits on the left.

The boss battle at the top of the tower is a simulacrum of Esemaryl that absolutely will not part with the amulet, and 4 helmed horrors. In the room beyond the battle is Esemaryl's private study. Inside is her body which seems to have been smited by some radiant energy. She has been dead for many, many years. The amulet is still clutched in her hands.

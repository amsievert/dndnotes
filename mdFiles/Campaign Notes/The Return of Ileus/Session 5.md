Day: 26th of Florum, 2519 PS

Throughout their time in the city, the party may notice some shifty looking goblins trailing them throughout the city. Outside the city, the goblins from earlier and one of Kardag's mages have a camp set up where they are waiting for their spies to bring back the Helvalic notes.

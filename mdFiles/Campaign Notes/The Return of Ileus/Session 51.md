The Bottom Floor - Forbidden Archive

The cage elevator stops in another large hall. This one has almost nothing in it. It is very dim, with glowing murals depicting the falls of the Ancient Archmages. There is a beholder here that is unavoidable, as they see the elevator as soon as it lands on the floor. Behind them is an arched doorway with large stone doors, locked with a weirdly-shaped lock. Dark energy seems to spill out from behind the doors.

As the elevator reaches the bottom, a sending spell is broadcasted through the sending stone stolen from the guards in the Atrium. Bing calls out through the spell saying that he's getting overwhelmed by SCMMs.

The beholder's name is Qaamdukarsi, Keeper of Tomes. He guards the Forbidden Archive and holds the key to the doors, a strange icosahedron that he keeps on a string around one of his eye stalks. It is said that Qaamdurkarsi knows every single book in the entire Sanctum Arcana, and that the dark energy of the Forbidden Archive has corrupted his mind by feeding and mutating it into thinking that without the books of the Sanctum he would die.

After the beholder is defeated, its body can be looted for the key to the locked door. Inside is a dark hallway that leads to the Library of the Damned. Upon entering this room, the characters feel oppressed by the energy in the room. Most of the books in here are chained shut, and there are glyphs of warding that activate when a knock spell is cast in the room. This is where the book is that details the story of the Spear of the Blood Chief.

Abyss Encounters:
After wandering around in the Gaping Maw for a little while, the party hears screams coming from somewhere a little ways off. In a small clearing, a Glabrezu and a Barlgura stand around a metal cage with a gnome man inside. The Glabrezu continuously casts Heat Metal on the cage, and both of the demons laugh to themselves as the gnome writhes in pain. The gnome is actually just the soul of a man who's soul accidentally ended up in the Abyss. His name is Bembenbrank Stumpenbump. He knows of a group of paladins and clerics that came through earlier on some sort of expedition.

There is indeed a group of 3 clerics and 2 paladins taking shelter in a nearby cave. They are all servants of the God Arbitros and they are here tracking down a Marilith that recently attacked a temple in the city of Myrn in Enulon. If the party helps them, the priests could agree to help them break into the Palace of Betrayal.

The Marilith's name is Virezzara, and she runs a small gang of demons called the Mawbrand Legion. The Legion attacked the party of priests when they first arrived in the Gaping Maw, and captured one of their paladins, Sir Jorik. The first mission that the party helps with is to find Sir Jorik.

The clerics take them back to the spot where they were first attacked. There are signs of battle, and a path that leads off the trail and away from the site. Following the trail slightly, it splits in two directions.

"In front of you the trail splits in two directions. To the left, the ground is scarred and uneven. Broken twigs, smoldering leaves, and faint, erratic footprints are scattered throughout. The air smells faintly acrid. To the right, the path appears unnaturally pristine. The ground is smooth and undisturbed in an oddly uniform manner, too perfect to be trusted completely."

Down the right (incorrect) path, the trail leads into an underground tunnel. The ceiling drips and oozes. As they all reach a certain point, the tunnel collapses suddenly behind them. Anyone that fails a DC 20 Dex save takes 3d10 acid damage and is knocked prone. It becomes very apparent that the tunnel walls are made of flesh, and the collapse behind them is more akin to a throat closing. A gurgling sound can be heard from further within the tunnel, and acid quickly starts rising from the ground. The party needs to do 150 damage in 1 turn to open the throat and escape. For each round they fail, they all take 2d10 acid damage and the required damage drops by 50 (maybe 25 depending on how close?).

Down the left path, the smell of brimstone and rot only intensifies. After another 30 minutes of travel, the party comes across the site of another ambush, but it seems that the Legion were the ones being ambushed this time. The ground is scattered with dead quasits, and a few dead weaker demons from the Legion. However, there is also a wounded Legion demon left behind among the bodies. His legs are completely separated and he is slowly dying. He only mutters periodically: "Silent sentinel" "Forgotten by time" "Steeple" "Coil seeks". If pressed sufficiently the demon lies and points the party towards a distant mountain. The mountain is a trap, and it either has the acid trap if unused, or has 2 yuan-ti anathemas otherwise.

Further down the correct path, it looks as though the party was attacked again, but this time by another organized band of demons. A tiefling woman is picking through the corpses. She is friendly. Her brother was a prisoner held by the attacking gang. He was killed during the battle by the corrupted Sir Jorik. She asks the party to kill him if they find him, and she sends them in the direction that they went.

Halfway through the interrogation, a blood rain starts, and the party must protect the tiefling, or she will die from the acidic rain.

At the end of the path, is a small camp where Sir Jorik and 4 cambions are resting, healing from their wounds. The clerics want to spare and redeem Sir Jorik, but the tiefling really wants him dead.

If spared, Sir Jorik knows exactly where Virezzara is, otherwise he blurts out something about an Obsidian Tower before he dies.

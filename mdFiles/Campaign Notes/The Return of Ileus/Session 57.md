Current Day: 7th Friga, 2519 PS

Island Overall Arc:
The portal is in a temple that Invexeor at one point used to study necromancy along with a group of Mortessa clerics. Despite their connection to Mortessa, these clerics were sympathetic to the Anteitic cause and performed rituals to keep their divine magic. The portal to Hades has since been closed by the remaining members of the Mortessa cult to protect Invexeor. The portal was actually created accidentally by Invexeor, who was searching for a way to achieve invulnerability without becoming a Lich. He took his experiments too far, and ended up sacrificing his first apprentice, Dravennon, on an altar to finally unlock the secret of true immortality. This sacrifice unleashed a tremendous amount of raw magical power that opened a portal to Hades. Due to the nature of Dravennon's death, his name was stricken from every record, and Invexeor is the only one that still remembers it. Everyone else remembers his second apprentice Lirin as his only apprentice. The only way to reopen the portal is to pour a drop of blood from Dravennon's sacrifice (which can be obtained from the altar in the north), and to speak Dravennon's name, since it has become forgotten by time.

The cult of Mortessa that worked with Invexeor is still on the island, but they are all undead by this point. They wear bronze masks and wear dark gray/green robes with bronze gilding around the edges. The masks give them the power to see through the islands mists.

Island Landmarks:
On the northern shore of the island is the altar of Dravennon's sacrifice. Touching the altar at any point shows the toucher shards of Dravennon's memory of the sacrifice (Knife flash, hot pain, dedication). To unlock the full memory, one must lay on the altar like one ready to be sacrificed. At this point, if they draw blood, their own blood becomes the blood of Dravennon.

At the center of the island is a rocky hill that has some sort of colossal skull set in the cliff face. The skull is that of an ancient giant, one of the early descendants of Annam, whose skull has since grown to its massive size. The eyes of the skull are entrances to the lair of the Mortessa Cult.

The temple with the portal is between the Cult Lair and the altar. It was once a grand place of research but is since decrepit and corrupted by the power of Hades.

Just inland from the southern beach is the bleeding tree. This tree's birch-like bark constantly bleeds blood red sap. Interacting with tree, the interactor feels the tree's desire for a willing sacrifice at its roots. If this is accomplished, the tree alerts the party of the cultists that are constantly watching through the fog.

ARID Temple (Arcane Research Institute of Death):
The front door to the temple has three skulls on the front of it. The door itself is no more than a massive stone slab. To the side is a small plaque that says: "For any of you priests having issues remembering the correct button, I've inscribed a simple puzzle on the skulls to keep your minds fresh. Simply push in the skull that is the only correct choice. Just remember: at least one statement is true, and at least one statement is false."

Once this plaque is read, illusory script appears beneath the skulls. The party must get all three puzzles correct to open the door.

Puzzles:
1. Easy: Solution - Middle
	1. Left Skull: A skull next to this skull is the correct choice.
	2. Middle Skull: Both skulls next to this skull are the correct choice.
	3. Right Skull: A skull next to this skull is true.
2. Medium: Solution - Right
	1. Left Skull: The incorrect choice skulls both have true statements.
	2. Middle Skull: The left skull has a true statement.
	3. Right Skull: This skull is the correct choice.
3. Hard: Solution - Middle
	1. Left Skull: Only one statement is false
	2. Middle Skull: Only one statement is true
	3. Right Skull: The correct choice is a skull with a false statement

First room: "Notice of Relocation"
The first room is a fairly standard temple to Mortessa. Hanging on the wall over the altar is the symbol of Mortess, an inverted hourglass with the sand flowing upwards. This room is also filled with fog like outside. Part of the fog is 2 vampiric mists that stalk the party and attack as they explore. In the temple room is a simple map of the island. There are murals on the wall that depict the Fracture and Mortessa's creation of destined death. There are other murals that depict the work done in ARID. A robed figure raises various undead creatures from the ground. One shows him symbolically conquering death. The last part, closest to the altar, has been scratched, scarred, and burned in an attempt to erase it. This part of the mural originally showed Invexeor sacrificing Dravennon.

On the altar is an official-looking notice: Notice of Relocation

Second Room: 1
The second room is clear of any mist. It appears to be some sort of storage room for the cult of Mortessa. There are crates of extra robes and masks. This room also contains the first entry from Invexeor's notebook.

Third Room: 3
The third room is a beautiful indoor garden. Silver-leafed trees grow from graves. Ghostly echoes of old cult members flicker and walk through the garden. Trail Puzzle.

At one point, the trail passes by a tree that has the third diary entry caught in its leaves.

Fourth Room:
The fourth room simply forks in two directions. One leads up in a spiral staircase towards Invexeor's old study. The other path leads to the experiment chambers. The door to the experiment chambers is locked. A switch in Invexeor's study opens it.

Invexeor's Study: 4 6 8 "Hypothesis Immortalitatis"
In this room, a cult member (Necromancer Wizard) sits at a desk while an Allip hovers menacingly over it, influencing its mind. The cult member has its hood down and no mask, and is frantically writing on a piece of paper.

If the party attempts to approach the cult member, the Allip turns and tries to stop them or scare them away. The Allip used to be a cult member who spoke Dravennon's name and was turned into an Allip. He is trying to get another member to write down the name so he can pass on.

This room also contains diary entries 4, 6, and 8. The eighth diary entry is among the piles of notes that the cult member is writing. Also among this pile is the Hypothesis Immortalitatis

Experiment Chambers: 5 "On Sacrifice Sites"
This is a massive maze of halls that has over 100 small ritual rooms with altars in them. Each room is stained with blood. At end of the maze, down a few levels, is a small office. This office has a note about the curious nature of the altars sometimes. The office also has diary entry 5

Final Room: 7
The final room is a large open circular room that contains the portal in the middle. A death tyrant guards it unfailingly. Mandatory combat. The death tyrant has diary entry 7 on its body.

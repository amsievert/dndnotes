Current Day: 9th Friga, 2519 PS

Hithva Lair:
Both eye sockets lead into entrance storage chambers that have crates with basic storage of quills, paper, and other ritual components.

In the center of the lair is the Prayer Hall. Braziers lit with incense line the walls and provide light for the room. The flames flicker and reflect off of the giant hourglass in the middle. The hourglass is a physical manifestation of the symbol of Mortessa. The whole thing is about 20 feet tall and 15 feet wide. The sand from the bottom flows upwards into the top of the hourglass. It seems to flow forever, never filling the top or emptying the bottom. At the front of the chapel is a massive statue of Mortessa. The statue depicts her in a flowing dress and veil, face partially obscured. The parts of her face obscured by the veil show only skull. In one hand she holds a perfectly balanced scale. In the other hand, she holds her signature hourglass.

On the right side of the map is the Ossuary storage room. A thin metal catwalk hangs suspended over pits of assorted bones. These bones are used for different rituals.

Mirroring the Ossuary storage on the left side is the Hall of Whispered Names. All along the walls are thousands of names carved into the walls. In the center of the room is a quill made of bone on a pedestal. These names are the cult's at recording all of the souls that pass through the Scales of Life. The cult is obsessed with tracking those who have died, and they feel that doing so is their service to Mortessa. This is a combination of the wizardly desire to record everything and the priestly desire to serve your deity.

The top left of the map is the grafting laboratory. It has workbenches with various dead beasts and creatures strewn about. There are frankenstein monsters of various body parts. Behind a reinforced door is a room of jail cells with different flesh golems in them.

The top middle of the map is the mirror of souls. This mirror is able to peer into the location of any deceased soul in the afterlife. To do so requires the user to take 15 points of necrotic damage and have their hp max reduced by as much while on the island or in Hades. Carved into the stone frame of the mirror are the words: "To glimpse a shard of death granted by our lady requires a shard of life."

The top right of the map is the Raven King's scriptorium and inner sanctum. The scriptorium contains religious texts about Mortessa and different texts from the Scourge. Past the scriptorium is the inner sanctum, containing an altar where the interim cult leader prays. The scriptorium holds diary entry 2. And a note from Raven King Ossar about how he is leaving to accompany Invexeor in Hades.

Raven King Ossar is not in the Hithva lair. He has an interim leader retaining control currently. Ossar is in Invexeor's tower in Hades.

Spread across the Hithva lair are 5 death cultists and 10 cult fanatics. The interim leader is a necromancer wizard stat block.

Hades:
The party is spit out on a black sand beach on the edge of a pale, sluggish river. Undead ferrymen navigate gondolas up and down the river. The sky is overcast with a pale, sickly green. The air is at a weird point of being cold and warm at the same time. It feels like having a fever.

Off on the horizon they see the walls of a city. In between their current location and the city are groves of dry, dying poplar trees. Stalking amongst the trees is an Yagnoloth and a Mezzoloth that try to kill the party to offer their bodies to Corpus and gain entry for themselves.

Upon reaching the city (Corpus), the party is able to take in the sight that it is. The city is entirely made up of bodies, forming one organism. At the Shady Grove tavern, an Arcanaloth named Yurth offers to help the party search for clues of Invexeor in the city. In reality, Yurth wants to gain the party's trust to imprison them in his tome.

Clues to Invexeor's whereabouts:
The Corporeal Mason, the one in charge of building things out of bodies, knows of a secret hideout in the city that he built for Invexeor long ago.

The scribe of names that documents all who travel through the city offers to tell more of Invexeor if the party helps him kill an Oinoloth that is making parts of the wall sick.

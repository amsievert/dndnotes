Current Day: 16th Friga, 2519 PS

Hades:
The party is spit out on a black sand beach on the edge of a pale, sluggish river. Undead ferrymen navigate gondolas up and down the river. The sky is overcast with a pale, sickly green. The air is at a weird point of being cold and warm at the same time. It feels like having a fever.

Off on the horizon they see the walls of a city. In between their current location and the city are groves of dry, dying poplar trees. Stalking amongst the trees is an Yagnoloth and a Mezzoloth that try to kill the party to offer their bodies to Corpus and gain entry for themselves.

Upon reaching the city (Corpus), the party is able to take in the sight that it is. The city is entirely made up of bodies, forming one organism. At the Shady Grove tavern, an Arcanaloth named Nel offers to help the party search for clues of Invexeor in the city. In reality, Nel wants to gain the party's trust to imprison them in his tome.

The Corporeal Mason:
The Corporeal Mason is the one in charge of determining which bodies should go where and guides all construction in the city. His name is Mitel, a very old Nycaloth. The mention of Invexeor brings up bad memories. Back when Invexeor came through the city, he was constantly bugging Mitel, asking if he had any information on Dravennon. To top it all off, before Invexeor left, he stole a piece of the city's wall, trapping those souls forever.

The mason asks that the party helps him out in order to get his help in return. There is an oinoloth that has been making parts of the wall very sick. Mitel is far too old these days to take care of the Oinoloth himself. If the party kills the Oinoloth, he will tell them what he knows about Invexeor.

Once the Oinoloth is killed, Mitel tells the party his story. He says that he doesn't know where Invexeor went, but he asks the party to return the souls of the wall if they find it. He then tells the party that the Scribe of Names may be able to help them more.

The Scribe of Names:
The Scribe of Names is a cambion named Hazil. He greets the party and welcomes them to Corpus. Nel immediately comments that he does not recognize this man as the Scribe of Names he recognizes. Hazil continues on and seems generally knowledgeable. However, he denies that his records have any documentation of missing souls. He says that perhaps Mitel is misremembering because of his hatred for Invexeor. Hazil says that the party is free to scan the records if they like. As they scan, Hazil mentions how sad it was that the old Scribe Kilvu passed away. The party scans the records for a bit, noting all of the names of people that have come through the city over thousands of years.

After a while of scanning, Nel misty steps directly to Hazil and tackles him to the ground. He shouts, asking where Kilvu is. Hazil works for the Hollow Choir, a cult run by the old Raven King Ossar. They kidnapped Kilvu to cover up Invexeor's whereabouts. Kilvu will know of Invexeor's whereabouts, and he is being held at a hideout in the Bone ward.

Hollow Choir Hideout:
The hideout is a large mouth on the back of Po's Potions in the Bone ward. Inside is a cellar that has a Death Knight Aspirant and a Death Cultist that are guarding Kilvu.

Kilvu thanks the party for rescuing him and tells them how to find Invexeor's tower, directly out from the Mineral Gate. A week travel.

Before the party leaves the city, Nel picks one of them to show his tome that he has been recording their adventure in. He says he might have found something in the names from the Scribe's records. As the party member approaches, he attacks them with his soul tome attack and attempts to trap them inside, then turns on the rest of the party.

Invexeor Lore:
Invexeor served Mortessa during the Great Dissension. She taught him everything about death and necromancy. Invexeor was born in Ith Alora, where his parents got lost in the wilderness when he was young and he grew up having to scrap. When he was given the opportunity to fight for the gods, he enlisted right away. Originally, he actually fought for Genesis, where he met Ileus. Invexeor was killed in a battle, but since he was one of Genesis's top soldiers, she convinced Mortessa to bring him back to life. Instead of rejoining Genesis, he decided to learn more from Mortessa and fight alongside her instead.

He knows basic information about Ileus's upbringing: From Monfort, fought for Genesis.

Despite traveling to Hades years before the Scourge, Invexeor still fought alongside the other Archmages, he wasn't completely lost to the despair of Hades yet. He never returned to the ARID lab though, because he couldn't stand to see the site of his greatest failure again.

After the Scourge, Invexeor was bound to Hades. He began researching Chronomancy to try and travel back in time to save Dravennon. He never found out how to do it, and his work was later stolen by Ormyn Kaleth (Chronarch).

Nel's Soul Tome:
The inside of Nel's Soul Tome is a ruined library floating through the Astral Plane. Inside the library, there are books on lecterns that contain the stories of people's lives. The books contain energy that shows the reader visions.

One book shows the life of an interplanar merchant selling goods in the Great Bazaar in Sigil's Market Ward. He is selling mead from Arborea and fish from the Plane of Water.

Another book shows the life of an adventurer travelling through Hades looking for a lost lover.

Another book shows the life of a wizard from Spellhaven pouring over transmutation tomes in a cramped study.

Travel through Hades:
The party travels for a week through the gray wastes. On day 6, everyone makes a DC 15 wisdom saving throw. On a fail they are subjected to a Shadowfell Despair effect. The saving throw can be repeated after each long rest but the DC becomes 20.

Invexeor's Tower:
The door to Invexeor's Tower is protected by 3 more 3 skull puzzles:
1. Easy: Solution - Middle
	1. Left Skull: The right skull is true
	2. Middle Skull: The correct choice is the true skull
	3. Right Skull: The left skull is true
2. Medium: Solution - Left
	1. Left Skull: The correct choice is the only true skull
	2. Middle Skull: Only one statement is true
	3. Right Skull: The left skull is the correct choice
3. Hard: Solution - Middle
	1. Left Skull: The correct choice is a skull with a false statement
	2. Middle Skull: The left skull is false
	3. Right Skull: The middle skull is false

Upon correctly solving the puzzles, the door, rather than opening, teleports all nearby creatures to the entrance chamber of the tower.

The entrance chamber is a large rotunda. In the center is a large circular dais with faintly glowing runes on it. Upon approaching, a pre-recorded projected image of Invexeor appears. It states that the tower is no longer accepting visitors. It disappears and a new image appears. This one is Raven King Ossar, dressed in plate armor decorated with both the hourglass insignia of Mortessa and the mouthless skull insignia of the Hollow Choir. He states that any members of the Hollow Choir looking for an audience should step onto the dais and wait to be attended to.

If the party steps onto the teleportation circle, they are teleported to an audience chamber. Here they stand in a room reminiscent of a congressional hearing chamber, with a board of cult members at the front and elevated viewing platforms surrounding the rest of the room.

The cult member leading (a Mouth of Mortessa) the hearing asks the group to please step forward and state their business. If the Robe of the Dead is mentioned at all, the speaker grows very dismissive and is less likely to answer more of the party's questions. Off to the side of the room is another teleportation circle, identical to the previous room, except this one has a small control panel with a few stone buttons, each inscribed with a symbol.

Symbols:
- Two chairs facing each other: leads to the viewing balconies in this room
- Upside down L: leads to the cultist barracks
- Rectangle: leads to the laboratory where the cultists continue work on the grafting of bodies
- Four-pointed star: leads to the observatory in the point of the tower

Cultist Barracks:
Four cult fanatics and one death cultist attack the party as soon as they appear in this area

Laboratory:
A really bizarre scientist is surprised but welcoming to the new company. He says that no one ever visits him down here anymore.

Observatory:
A death themed githzerai enlightened is very suspicious of the party but doesn't attack on sight.

The observatory has another teleportation dais that has different symbols on its control panel. The cultist only lets the party use it if they gain his trust.
The symbols on this different control panel:
- Single chair: leads back to the audience room
- Hourglass: leads to the chrono-research laboratory
- Square: leads to the entrance chamber before Invexeor's study

Chrono-research laboratory:
Room with two massive hourglasses suspended from the ceiling by heavy chains. No enemies in the room. Levers in the room cause the hourglasses to turn with a terrible grating noise. The glass on the hourglasses has AC 5, 25 hp. The sand inside hides 1d4+2 100 gp diamonds, and a DC 15 investigation check finds a 500 gp diamond. Detect magic reveals faint hints of transmutation magic within the sand.

Around the lab are journals written by Invexeor regarding his research into chronomancy and trying to reverse time to bring back Dravennon. However, it seems like there should be more documentation about the actual findings but there isn't.

Entrance to Invexeor's Study:
Small lounge area where Raven King Ossar defends Invexeor's study. He is very angry at the party, calling them interlopers and traitors to Mortessa. He is angry at them for their actions on the island, and says that speaking the name of Dravennon has condemned all the cultists on the island to many more years of pain. He is also angry that they have broken into the tower and are attempting to obtain the Robe of the Dead, which in his mind, is the reason for all of the trouble in his life, since it represents the power of necromancy, which destroyed the island and his conclave of Mortessa priests. Nothing short of a DC 30 persuasion check would convince him to stand down.

For the fight: If the fight is going too easy, Raven King Ossar turns into a full Death Knight stat block when he reaches half health.

Invexeor's Study:
Inside Invexeor's study, he sits idly in a lavish armchair, fiddling with a skeletal finger in his own skeletal hand. He is fully a lich at this point, and somewhat despises it. He says he hates having to consume souls to stay alive, but he also says that its better than the alternative of becoming a demilich. Becoming a lich was actually not his choice, but was instead a curse placed upon him by Mortessa for meddling with death too much. Because of this, he can never die because she holds his Soul Talisman.

Invexeor's whole demeanor is very depressive. He has lived forever and the power of Hades has turned him into a depressed, apathetic husk.

He also mentions that his chronomancy documents were stolen by a mage named Ormyn Kaleth (the Chronarch).

He willingly gives up the Robe of the Dead, but cautions the party that it's power has brought him nothing but pain and suffering, and to be very careful with it.

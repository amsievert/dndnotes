Current Day: 18th of Friga, 2519 PS

Whispers of War:
Upon taking the refugees back to Grandfather Oak, Esylra takes note of the party and invites them to her home. She tells them a bit more about the refugee crisis. She has another issue with the refugees in Grandfather Oak. She has heard word that some of them may be planning some sort of violence and she wants the party to investigate it a bit further.

If the party can successfully talk to a few refugees, they uncover a small cell of Unweavers among the refugee camps here.

They can choose what to do with them. If they don't find the Unweavers, in a day, they attack Esylra's home.

The Unweavers are disguised, but they can be identified by their strange erratic behavior.

There are three refugees identified by others that might be suspicious:
One of the refugees that the party can meet is **Pelleas**, who is secretly an Unweaver. He was seen by Venali near Esylra's mansion.

**Venali** is suspicious because he has recently gained a lot of money. In reality, he found an old stash of money in the woods nearby. He was seen by Fanira sneaking into the woods recently.

**Fanira** is suspicious because she is a loner that doesn't interact with the other refugees. She was seen interacting with a strange man by Pelleas recently. This is a lie by Pelleas.

The Cell is being led by Utu's brother Hama. He is the one that leads the attack on Esylra's home.

The Council:
After uncovering the Unweaver plot, Esylra asks the party to travel to Harmonia's Tower with her to inform Harmonia and to ask her to do more about the Unweavers.

The Olympian Ruins:
Harbored in the Olympian Ruins is an Androsphinx named Kaarsi. Kaarsi is a leftover servant of one of the Olympian Gods (Athena). He has taken it upon himself to try and care for the remaining Olympian monsters. They have no food left in Olympia and need to take food from the wilds of Seldoris. Since the Seldorians don't seem to care about the refugees, they figured they were free to eat them instead of the fauna of Seldoris.

The Unweavers:
The group that is currently marauding across the Feywild raiding settlements to convert people to their cause of creating a new magical order. Their Leader, Dallim, is from Castellum, where he traveled into the Fey wilds and gained Wild Magic abilities. He took this as a sign from the universe that he was chosen to bring about a new order of magic by destroying the current Harmonia-Weave model. All members of the Unweavers that have embraced the wild fey magic can be incredibly volatile with mood swings and multiple personalities.

The Unweavers ultimate goal is to gain enough followers to travel to Arborea and kill Harmonia.

Utu's brother, Hama is a high-ranking member of the Unweavers that has been corrupted by Dallim's teachings.

Dallim is going to destroy and recruit from one more town in the Feywild, Lethandil. After that, he is going to begin his assault on Harmonia's Palace in Seldoris. If the party is able to deduce that Dallim plans to assault Lethandil, they can attempt to stop his assault there and kill him.

The Unweaver's home base is the ruins of Castellum. If the party makes it here or to Lethandil, they will meet Hama (Utu's brother).

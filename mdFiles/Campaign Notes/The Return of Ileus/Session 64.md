Current Day: 19th of Friga, 2519 PS

The Council:
After uncovering the Unweaver plot, Esylra asks the party to travel to Harmonia's Tower with her to inform Harmonia and to ask her to do more about the Unweavers.

The Olympian Ruins:
Harbored in the Olympian Ruins is an Androsphinx named Kaarsi. Kaarsi is a leftover servant of one of the Olympian Gods (Athena). He has taken it upon himself to try and care for the remaining Olympian monsters. They have no food left in Olympia and need to take food from the wilds of Seldoris. Since the Seldorians don't seem to care about the refugees, they figured they were free to eat them instead of the fauna of Seldoris.

The Unweavers:
The group that is currently marauding across the Feywild raiding settlements to convert people to their cause of creating a new magical order. Their Leader, Dallim, is from Castellum, where he traveled into the Fey wilds and gained Wild Magic abilities. He took this as a sign from the universe that he was chosen to bring about a new order of magic by destroying the current Harmonia-Weave model. All members of the Unweavers that have embraced the wild fey magic can be incredibly volatile with mood swings and multiple personalities.

The Unweavers ultimate goal is to gain enough followers to travel to Arborea and kill Harmonia.

Utu's brother, Hama is a high-ranking member of the Unweavers that has been corrupted by Dallim's teachings.

Dallim's Plan:
Dallim is going to destroy and recruit from one more town in the Feywild, Lethandil. After that, he is going to begin his assault on Harmonia's Palace in Seldoris. If the party is able to deduce that Dallim plans to assault Lethandil, they can attempt to stop his assault there and kill him.

The Unweaver's home base is the ruins of Castellum. If the party makes it here or to Lethandil, they will meet Hama (Utu's brother).

#### Exploring Lethandil
If the party travels to Lethandil, they find a city in the midst of being infected by Unweaver ideology. The city is run by High Fey that withhold higher means of magic from the masses. The town guard are trying to crack down on Unweaver activity, but they remain uncaught for the most part. Sensing the growing tension, some people are starting to leave for [[Seldoris]].

Dallim is going to attack the city in two days.

Encounters in Lethandil:
As the party is traveling around Lethandil, a random person named Myde (Mee-day) suddenly has a wild magic surge go off from them. Deal with the fallout of whatever effect happens.

The party hears whispers of a speech that Dallim is going to make later in the evening. The speech takes place beneath a magical willow tree that when you cross beneath the hanging limbs, you find yourself in a much larger interior than makes sense. Inside this amphitheater, Dallim gives a speech before a medium-sized crowd:
"Greetings to you all, you humble freefolk of Lethandil. Regrettably, our time tonight is limited. Agents of the tyrant Weavemother and her Concinnous House lackeys hunt me at every waking minute. Nevertheless, I stand here in front of you tonight to deliver good tidings from the Universe itself, for it has spoken to me and I have listened. *Long pause for applause*. The time has come. Look at your ledgers. Look at the lists where names are ranked and promises withheld. Who wrote them? Who taught you that some hands are fit for power and some are not? I say never again. I say burn the lists, break the Concinnity, and listen. The Universe sings. It offers the chance to be more than footnotes in their books. Yes, it asks a price. All great things do. Will you pay it, or will you still bow and hope for crumbs?"
At this point the crowd erupts in cheers. Over the applause, Dallim calls out, "Tomorrow night you shall bear witness to the great Unweaving. Should you wish to see it yourself, find your way into the bluffs before sunset."
With that, Dallim teleports away.

On the second afternoon, the Concinnous Houses have a meeting to discuss the "Insurrectionist" activity. They are unsure what exactly is happening, but they believe that the citizens are feeling emboldened by the recent attacks elsewhere in the Feywild and are using them to rise up against the Houses.

The attack:
If Dallim isn't dead within the two days, the attack commences. He stands at the top of the bluffs with Ileus alongside him and uses Wish to cast Meteor Swarm, and then casts Earthquake to destroy the city, sparing those who left beforehand.

Wherever the party ends up fighting Dallim, Ileus watches from afar, studying for his own inevitable fight with the party.

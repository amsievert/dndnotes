Current Day: 19th of Friga, 2519 PS

The Council:
After uncovering the Unweaver plot, Esylra asks the party to travel to Harmonia's Tower with her to inform Harmonia and to ask her to do more about the Unweavers.

The Olympian Ruins:
Harbored in the Olympian Ruins is an Androsphinx named Kaarsi. Kaarsi is a leftover servant of one of the Olympian Gods (Athena). He has taken it upon himself to try and care for the remaining Olympian monsters. They have no food left in Olympia and need to take food from the wilds of Seldoris. Since the Seldorians don't seem to care about the refugees, they figured they were free to eat them instead of the fauna of Seldoris.

The Unweavers:
The group that is currently marauding across the Feywild raiding settlements to convert people to their cause of creating a new magical order. Their Leader, Dallim, is from Castellum, where he traveled into the Fey wilds and gained Wild Magic abilities. He took this as a sign from the universe that he was chosen to bring about a new order of magic by destroying the current Harmonia-Weave model. All members of the Unweavers that have embraced the wild fey magic can be incredibly volatile with mood swings and multiple personalities.

The Unweavers ultimate goal is to gain enough followers to travel to Arborea and kill Harmonia.

Utu's brother, Hama is a high-ranking member of the Unweavers that has been corrupted by Dallim's teachings.

Dallim's Plan:
Dallim is going to destroy and recruit from one more town in the Feywild, Lethandil. After that, he is going to begin his assault on Harmonia's Palace in Seldoris. If the party is able to deduce that Dallim plans to assault Lethandil, they can attempt to stop his assault there and kill him.

The Unweaver's home base is the ruins of Castellum. If the party makes it here or to Lethandil, they will meet Hama (Utu's brother).

#### Exploring Lethandil
If the party travels to Lethandil, they find a city in the midst of being infected by Unweaver ideology. The city is run by High Fey that withhold higher means of magic from the masses. The town guard are trying to crack down on Unweaver activity, but they remain uncaught for the most part. Sensing the growing tension, some people are starting to leave for [[Seldoris]].

### The Fight in the Bluffs
As soon as the fight breaks out, Ileus teleports to a nearby cliff, high above the battlefield and watches over the fight, studying the party's tactics. Dallim waits near the back of his group by the cliff. He lets his Unweavers handle the party and the bladesingers for as long as possible, firing spells from afar. The fight consists of 15 [Unweavers](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Wild_Magic_Sorcerer_(5e_NPC)), 6 [Bladesingers](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Bladesinger_(5e_Creature)), [Hama](https://www.emptyhexes.com/monster-mondays/npc-sorcerer), and Dallim.

Unweavers Battle Strategy:
Target Utu and Saraq first. Use Cone of Cold or Magic Missile for both.
Use upcasted Magic Missile to target Astarius.
Use Chaos Bolt or normal fire bolt for Holfog.

Bladesingers Battle Strategy:
Three rush into the Unweavers to engage in melee, while the other three hang back for spells.
Melee Bladesingers: Cast shadow blade and start swinging.
Ranged Bladesingers: Use fireball and counterspell.

Hama Battle Strategy:
Back up the other Unweavers where needed, but mostly focus on fighting the party.

Dallim Battle Strategy:
Use fly speed to escape counterspell and melee range and cast a chain lightning or delayed blast fireball on the Bladesingers. Then go after the party, goal is to always stay flying out of melee range.

Dallim has a contingency spell cast on him that activates when he gets below 30 hp. When it activates, it dimension doors him up to Ileus, who then teleports them away, back to Castellum.

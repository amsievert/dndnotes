### The Fight in the Bluffs
As soon as the fight breaks out, Ileus teleports to a nearby cliff, high above the battlefield and watches over the fight, studying the party's tactics. Dallim waits near the back of his group by the cliff. He lets his Unweavers handle the party and the bladesingers for as long as possible, firing spells from afar. The fight consists of 15 [Unweavers](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Wild_Magic_Sorcerer_(5e_NPC)), 6 [Bladesingers](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Bladesinger_(5e_Creature)), [Hama](https://www.emptyhexes.com/monster-mondays/npc-sorcerer), and Dallim.

Unweavers Battle Strategy:
Target Utu and Saraq first. Use Cone of Cold or Magic Missile for both.
Use upcasted Magic Missile to target Astarius.
Use Chaos Bolt or normal fire bolt for Holfog.

Bladesingers Battle Strategy:
Three rush into the Unweavers to engage in melee, while the other three hang back for spells.
Melee Bladesingers: Cast shadow blade and start swinging.
Ranged Bladesingers: Use fireball and counterspell.

Hama Battle Strategy:
Back up the other Unweavers where needed, but mostly focus on fighting the party.

Dallim Battle Strategy:
Use fly speed to escape counterspell and melee range and cast a chain lightning or delayed blast fireball on the Bladesingers. Then go after the party, goal is to always stay flying out of melee range.

Dallim has a contingency spell cast on him that activates when he gets below 30 hp. When it activates, it dimension doors him up to Ileus, who then teleports them away, back to Castellum.
#### IN THE EVENT OF A TPK
The party feel their souls leave for the Scales of Life in the Outlands. They appear in a long line of souls waiting to enter a large room through huge wooden doors. They wait around for a bit in the line before they feel their souls violently pulled back to their bodies. They regain consciousness and find themselves inside a forcecage, having been revived by Ileus. It is now night time in the Feywild, and Dallim is about to begin his attack on Lethandil. He briefly monologues to the party before telling them to witness true freedom and beginning his attack.

Meanwhile, Ileus prepares an Illusion that makes it appear as if the party is aiding in the attack alongside Dallim.

#### IN THE EVENT OF A ROD OF SECURITY USE
The remaining Unweavers ready their ambush on the spot the party left from. They lay a glyph of warding down on the spot and take up defensive positions. The glyph of warding contains a wall of force the traps whoever activated the rod. An alarm spell also triggers when this happens.

#### IN THE EVENT OF A SUCCESSFUL BATTLE
The attack on Lethandil is prevented and Ileus up on the cliff teleports away.


## The Hunt for the Shield
Harmonia believes that the Eladrin Seldori Siedus in Aubade Palace knows more about Ozewyn's adventures from the many years ago.

It takes Siedus some time to remember, but he directs the party to an old journal of Ozewyn's that he has lying around in his vault. The journal contains six phrases (locations?).

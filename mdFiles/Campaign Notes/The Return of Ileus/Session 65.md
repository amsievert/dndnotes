### The Fight in the Bluffs
As soon as the fight breaks out, Ileus teleports to a nearby cliff, high above the battlefield and watches over the fight, studying the party's tactics. Dallim waits near the back of his group by the cliff. He lets his Unweavers handle the party and the bladesingers for as long as possible, firing spells from afar. The fight consists of 15 [Unweavers](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Wild_Magic_Sorcerer_(5e_NPC)), 6 [Bladesingers](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Bladesinger_(5e_Creature)), [Hama](https://www.emptyhexes.com/monster-mondays/npc-sorcerer), and Dallim.

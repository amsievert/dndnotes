Current Day: 21st of Friga, 2519 PS

## The Aftermath
As the party collects their belongings, they see Dallim address his followers and begin leading them through the Fey Wilds towards Castellum. It is an 8 day journey to Castellum.

After reconvening in Castellum, Dallim preps for 2 days before beginning his assault on Seldoris. This time, he has a few Unweavers ahead of him that have a small camp in the woods outside of Harmonia's Palace. From there, they will stage a distraction frontal assault while Dallim invisibly sneaks up to the throne room and kills Harmonia. The procedure of killing Harmonia is via a special spell that he designed with the help of Ileus. Only Dallim is able to cast it because of his connection to the Unweave.

A few hours after the attack on Lethandil, Astarius receives a sending message from Harmonia who is very angry and asking what happened. She has been hearing word that the party joined with Dallim to attack Lethandil. She can be persuaded and asks the party to return immediately.

## Options
The party has a few options:
- [[#Attacking Dallim on the Road|Attack]] Dallim on the road to Castellum
- [[#Relic Heist|Go to Castellum]] and try to steal back some of the relics before Ileus sends them back to his demiplane
- [[#More Refugees|Try to solve]] the new refugee crisis
- [[#The Aftermath|Prepare]] for a potential attack on Seldoris
- [[#The Shield of Ozewyn|Find the Shield]] of Ozewyn

### Attacking Dallim on the Road
Dallim only has his six remaining Unweavers left with him as he travels with his new followers on the way through the Feywild. Harmonia is able to teleport the party close to his position so they can jump him on the road. However, she emphasizes that they must prepare carefully.

### Relic Heist
The party can get tipped off to this quest because the spear still communicates with Utu.

Ileus, Dallim, and the Unweavers are settled in the destroyed Castle Keep in Castellum. The keep has multiple holes in the walls, but the tall walls still offer decent protection. The camp is under the effect of a [Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mordenkainens-private-sanctum). Ileus's workshop in the camp is at the top of a crooked tower that sits at the corner of the keep. There are windows and an observatory telescope at the top, as well as a few bricks missing from the walls on the way up. The windows are trapped with hold person glyphs, and the stairs are trapped with [Symbol](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:symbol) (pain) spells.

Ileus hardly ever leaves the study, and rarely takes his eyes off the relics, since this is a Simulacrum and doesn't need to sleep. When he does leave the relics, he puts them in a "Chest of holding", a locked chest with a DC 22 arcane lock that has the effect of a bag of holding. He is still working on analyzing the artifacts, but it seems the Amulet of Greater Health and the Hammer of Epius have already been sent back to his demiplane.

### More Refugees
With Lethandil destroyed, there are even more refugees and Seldoris is very close to boiling over. Dallim must be killed or the refugees need a new place to stay in Seldoris.

The option of the Olympian Ruins remains:
Harbored in the Olympian Ruins is an Androsphinx named Kaarsi. Kaarsi is a leftover servant of one of the Olympian Gods (Athena). He has taken it upon himself to try and care for the remaining Olympian monsters. They have no food left in Olympia and need to take food from the wilds of Seldoris. Since the Seldorians don't seem to care about the refugees, they figured they were free to eat them instead of the fauna of Seldoris.

### [[Relics of Dissension|The Shield of Ozewyn]]
Harmonia believes that the Eladrin Seldori Siedus in Aubade Palace knows more about Ozewyn's adventures from the many years ago. **MAKE SURE TO MENTION OZEWYN HAVING A DRAGON COMPANION NAMED VES** (short for Vestryl)

It takes Siedus some time to remember, but he directs the party to an old [[Ozewyn's Journal|journal of Ozewyn's]] that he has lying around in his vault. The journal contains six phrases and possible locations. Siedus is familiar with the Murmuring Sanctum, as it is one of the places that Ozewyn loved to travel to most. The Sanctum is located in the forest not terribly far from Aubade Palace.
#### The Murmuring Sanctum
The Murmuring Sanctum is a small clearing with a small babbling brook that runs through it and seemingly infinite leaves that fall on the ground. However, neither the brook nor the leaves make any noise as they fall.

A small forest spirit named Ping lives in the glade and knows the notes to deactivate the ward, but can only speak them aloud, which can't happen because of the silence. An ornate lute lies in the center of the clearing and is the only item that can make noise here. A DC 13 performance check quiets the glade. On a fail, the glade becomes angry and the leaves become still in the air. The party feels the air being sucked from the area, and if 2 more performance checks fail, they will begin to suffocate.

With the silence dispelled, Ping can deactivate the ward, and also knows of the location of the Crystal Canopy. It is deep in Lolth's Grove, beneath the thick dark canopies there.
#### The Crystal Canopy
The Crystal Canopy is a spot in Lolth's Grove where a small beam of sunlight has cracked through the Canopy and is reflected off of silver pools of liquid and the reflective leaves of trees that are growing here.

The ward can be deactivated by blocking the sunlight, but as the party is exploring the pool, a Drow Favored Consort casts a darkness spell over the hole in the canopy making the entire area full darkness. The consort then attacks from 120 feet away with arcane eruption attacks.

If the silvery pools are illuminated and are fallen into, the creature take 4d10 radiant damage.
#### Null Island
Siedus puts the party in contact with a sailor he knows named Aimar. Aimar is a sea elf who has traveled on Aquallor many times before. He lets the party travel on his Catamaran, as he takes them to where he believes Null Island is. He explains that the island is mostly unexplored since magic doesn't work on it.

The island itself is no more than a mile across in both directions with low tree cover and a shallow shield volcano that rises in the middle, poking just above the trees. In the Volcano's caldera amidst the lava, 2 fire elemental myrmidons guard a glyph on a pedestal that is protected by a fire shield fueled by the elementals, who must be killed to break the shield.

Among some small trinkets around the glyph is an hourglass with sand in it, but also a tiny crystal that *tinks* against the glass inside, trying to return somewhere, acting as a sort of compass. It is pointing to Hourglass Isle.
#### Hourglass Isle
Following the small crystal leads the party to another island on Aquallor where time has completely frozen. The ship gets stuck in the water a few hundred feet off the shore since the water is stuck in time. This island is larger than the last, and has wildlife, all frozen in time. The crystal leads the party to an overhang cave. Inside the cave is a glyph made up of similar looking crystals to the one in the hourglass. To deactivate the glyph, the crystal must be released from the hourglass, whereupon it shatters the glyph and deactivates the ward.

As this last ward is deactivated, the whole plane shakes and a brief chord rings out through the sky. Harmonia immediately calls the party and asks what happened. She brings them back to her palace.
#### The Ward of Resonance
With all the other Wards deactivated, Harmonia can now hear the song of the final ward. It is calling from the Forbidden Realm of Mithardir. This forgotten third layer of Arborea is a vast white sand desert with ruins of ancient civilization. This also belonged to a pantheon of gods from the Dissension who were killed. However, all of the followers of these gods were also killed during the war, so the degradation of the layer is greatly increased. 

Harmonia sends the party to the location where she is hearing the song from. At the location in the desert is a small ring of 5 rune-inscribed stones. 4 of them are inactive now, but the last one is glowing hotly, almost vibrating trying to contain whatever is inside this ring. If the stone is removed from the ring, or magically dispelled, the last ward breaks and a massive shockwave blasts out from the ring. Everyone makes a DC 15 Dexterity Save, and is thrown back 20 feet on a fail. As the shockwave spreads, it blows all of the nearby sand away, revealing the area around the party.

They are standing at the top of a large stone temple. As they make their way through the temple, they find all different kinds of imagery depicting the Fracture, the Dissension, the Scourge, even the Age of Dragons. Walking through the temple feels like walking through history.

Eventually they find themselves in a large chapel with draconic imagery. There is a secret door behind the altar in this chapel that leads underground. After following a dark, winding path, some parts blocked by sand. They find themselves inside a massive underground cavern. In the center of the cavern the see the remains of an adult dragon (Vestryl). On the front of the dragons chest, the Shield is attach to the ribs. As the party approaches the remains, they reanimate.

As Vestryl stands in front of the party, a voice rumbles through the cavern. It calls for those worthy to defeat him in combat and take up the mantle. Vestryl can use the shield stuck to his chest as if he was wielding it normally.

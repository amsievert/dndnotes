Current Day: 21st of Friga, 2519 PS

## The Aftermath
As the party collects their belongings, they see Dallim address his followers and begin leading them through the Fey Wilds towards Castellum. It is an 8 day journey to Castellum.

After reconvening in Castellum, Dallim preps for 2 days before beginning his assault on Seldoris. This time, he has a few Unweavers ahead of him that have a small camp in the woods outside of Harmonia's Palace. From there, they will stage a distraction frontal assault while Dallim invisibly sneaks up to the throne room and kills Harmonia. The procedure of killing Harmonia is via a special spell that he designed with the help of Ileus. Only Dallim is able to cast it because of his connection to the Unweave.

A few hours after the attack on Lethandil, Astarius receives a sending message from Harmonia who is very angry and asking what happened. She has been hearing word that the party joined with Dallim to attack Lethandil. She can be persuaded and asks the party to return immediately.

## Options
The party has a few options:
- [[#Attacking Dallim on the Road|Attack]] Dallim on the road to Castellum
- [[#Relic Heist|Go to Castellum]] and try to steal back some of the relics before Ileus sends them back to his demiplane
- Try to solve the new refugee crisis
- Prepare for a potential attack on Seldoris
- Find the Shield of Ozewyn

### Attacking Dallim on the Road
Dallim only has his six remaining Unweavers left with him as he travels with his new followers on the way through the Feywild. Harmonia is able to teleport the party close to his position so they can jump him on the road. However, she emphasizes that they must prepare carefully.

### Relic Heist
Ileus, Dallim, and the Unweavers are settled in the destroyed Castle Keep in Castellum. The keep has multiple holes in the walls, but the tall walls still offer decent protection. The camp is under the effect of a [Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mordenkainens-private-sanctum).

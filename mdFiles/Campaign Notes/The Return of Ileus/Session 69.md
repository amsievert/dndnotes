### [[Relics of Dissension|The Shield of Ozewyn]]
#### The Crystal Canopy
##### Lolth's Grove Encounters
While traveling from the Olympian Ruins and over the mountains to Lolth's Grove, the mountain pass is guarded by two Drow Warriors named Istoril and Kia. They question the party on their coming from the Olympian ruins and warn them that the grove may be hard to traverse for them. They know what the Crystal Canopy is and are scared of it because of the daylight.

While traveling through the darkness of the grove, rustling can be heard near the party. A strange vibrating squawking can be heard surrounding the party. After circling the party for a bit, a drow child emerges from the undergrowth. The child's name is Zarra. After brief talking, a hooked horror jumps from the undergrowth towards Zarra and the party. This hooked horror is Zarra's pet named Hoohoo. Zarra has grown up in the woods for her whole life, and she believes that she was born from the trees.

After following the light of the canopy for a while, another smaller light becomes visible. If followed, this light is a small patch of glowing mushroom stalks. At the center of the patch is a large bone glowing with the same light as the mushroom stalks. A DC 13 medicine check reveals that this bone is the tip of a toe bone. A DC 18 religion or arcana check reveals some divine nature of this large bone piece. The glowing mushrooms can be harvested to get 1d6 mushrooms that act as healing potions.

The Crystal Canopy is a spot in Lolth's Grove where a small beam of sunlight has cracked through the Canopy and is reflected off of silver pools of liquid and the reflective leaves of trees that are growing here.

The ward can be deactivated by blocking the sunlight, but as the party is exploring the pool, a Drow Favored Consort casts a darkness spell over the hole in the canopy making the entire area full darkness. The consort then attacks from 120 feet away with arcane eruption attacks.

If the silvery pools are illuminated and are fallen into, the creature takes 4d10 radiant damage.

The Drow was not the original defender of this ward. The original defender was an Eladrin whose bones can found half submerged in one of the glowing pools. However, the Drow was driven mad by the power of the sun shining through the clearing. On the Drow's body, the area around its exposed eyes is cracked and burned and the eyes themselves have a crazy look. The rest of the Drow's body is covered in veins that appear to be flowing with the same silvery look as the pools.
#### Null Island
Siedus puts the party in contact with a sailor he knows named Aimar. Aimar is a sea elf who has traveled on Aquallor many times before. He lets the party travel on his Catamaran, as he takes them to where he believes Null Island is. He explains that the island is mostly unexplored since magic doesn't work on it.
##### Aquallor Encounters
When travelling on Aimar's ship, a long rest can only be taken when docked on land.

Sailing to Null Island takes two weeks.

One night, Aimar remarks that Naivara the resurgent goddess has graced the ship with her presence. The full moon hangs in the sky, brighter and larger than ever seen on the Material Plane. The ship lurches as Aimar fights the shifting tides for a moment before getting the ship back under control. Later in the night, Aimar points out that they are going to have to stop for a few hours because the tide will get very low. When this happens, the sea life retreats to small chasms in the ground where water remains. This also reveals a shipwreck almost entirely submerged in the sea floor. Aimar goes to check it out. After some digging, a piece of the ship gets uncovered that has an insignia of a rearing Wyvern. Astarius can recognize this without a check as the insignia of the old [[Dalonstor#The Houses of Dalonstor|House Wymar from Dalonstor]]. The ship itself has skeletons in it of dead sailors. The ship is also rotated so that the bow is pointed straight up. If climbed all the down, at the back (bottom) of the ship is a large vault. The vault is surprisingly unrusted, as it is made of adamantine. The vault has a combination lock with five numbers, each between 0-99. In the captains quarters is the body of the captain, who has the combination to the vault inside his trifold hat. The combination is 20-37-07-12-57. Inside the vault is a treasure hoard containing 7,500 gp worth of art items (Painting of Dalonstor from atop King's Steps, Embroidered Silk Mantle set with moonstones, Gold circlet with 4 aquamarines), and 10,000 silver pieces. There is also an Ersatz Finger that acts as a mystery key (5% chance to unlock a lock that it is stuck in).

The island itself is no more than a mile across in both directions with low tree cover and a shallow shield volcano that rises in the middle, poking just above the trees. In the Volcano's caldera amidst the lava, 2 fire elemental myrmidons guard a glyph on a pedestal that is protected by a fire shield fueled by the elementals, who must be killed to break the shield.

Among some small trinkets around the glyph is an hourglass with sand in it, but also a tiny crystal that *tinks* against the glass inside, trying to return somewhere, acting as a sort of compass. It is pointing to Hourglass Isle.
#### Hourglass Isle
Following the small crystal leads the party to another island on Aquallor where time has completely frozen. The ship gets stuck in the water a few hundred feet off the shore since the water is stuck in time. This island is larger than the last, and has wildlife, all frozen in time. The crystal leads the party to an overhang cave. Inside the cave is a glyph made up of similar looking crystals to the one in the hourglass. To deactivate the glyph, the crystal must be released from the hourglass, whereupon it shatters the glyph and deactivates the ward.

As this last ward is deactivated, the whole plane shakes and a brief chord rings out through the sky. Harmonia immediately calls the party and asks what happened. She brings them back to her palace.
#### The Ward of Resonance
With all the other Wards deactivated, Harmonia can now hear the song of the final ward. It is calling from the Forbidden Realm of Mithardir. This forgotten third layer of Arborea is a vast white sand desert with ruins of ancient civilization. This also belonged to a pantheon of gods from the Dissension who were killed. However, all of the followers of these gods were also killed during the war, so the degradation of the layer is greatly increased. 

Harmonia sends the party to the location where she is hearing the song from. At the location in the desert is a small ring of 5 rune-inscribed stones. 4 of them are inactive now, but the last one is glowing hotly, almost vibrating trying to contain whatever is inside this ring. If the stone is removed from the ring, or magically dispelled, the last ward breaks and a massive shockwave blasts out from the ring. Everyone makes a DC 15 Dexterity Save, and is thrown back 20 feet on a fail. As the shockwave spreads, it blows all of the nearby sand away, revealing the area around the party.

They are standing at the top of a large stone temple. As they make their way through the temple, they find all different kinds of imagery depicting the Fracture, the Dissension, the Scourge, even the Age of Dragons. Walking through the temple feels like walking through history.

Eventually they find themselves in a large chapel with draconic imagery. There is a secret door behind the altar in this chapel that leads underground. After following a dark, winding path, some parts blocked by sand. They find themselves inside a massive underground cavern. In the center of the cavern the see the remains of an adult dragon (Vestryl). On the front of the dragons chest, the Shield is attach to the ribs. As the party approaches the remains, they reanimate. (Dracolich)

As Vestryl stands in front of the party, a voice rumbles through the cavern. It calls for those worthy to defeat him in combat and take up the mantle. Vestryl can use the shield stuck to his chest as if he was wielding it normally.

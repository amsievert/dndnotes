Current Day: 17th of Glanix, 2520 PS

As Vestryl stands in front of the party, a voice rumbles through the cavern. It calls for those worthy to defeat him in combat and take up the mantle. Vestryl can use the shield stuck to his chest as if he was wielding it normally.
## Present Day Mondrall
Following the Alliance's army discovering the devastation of Mondrall during the Dissension, they cleaned up the bodies of the few garrisoned troops that were left in the city's barracks, then left the city as it was.

The city used to have a nice stone brick wall around its exterior, but they were destroyed by Orcish siege engines during the sacking. Near the top of the gently sloped town is a large barracks and training ground. In the middle of the large training yard is a huge funeral pyre now covered with foliage. The skeletons are wearing plate armor with the symbol of Genesis emblazoned on them.
### Ileus's Childhood House
In a small house near the bottom wall of Mondrall, the players can find a very strong illusion spell covering the whole house. The outside of the house appears unchanged, but once the party steps inside, the entire interior is made to look like an idyllic snapshot of when Ileus's parents were alive.

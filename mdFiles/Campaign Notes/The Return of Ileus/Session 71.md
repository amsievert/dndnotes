Current Day: 19th of Glanix, 2520 PS

As Vestryl stands in front of the party, a voice rumbles through the cavern. It calls for those worthy to defeat him in combat and take up the mantle. Vestryl can use the shield stuck to his chest as if he was wielding it normally.
## Present Day Mondrall
Following the Alliance's army discovering the devastation of Mondrall during the Dissension, they cleaned up the bodies of the few garrisoned troops that were left in the city's barracks, then left the city as it was.

The city used to have a nice stone brick wall around its exterior, but they were destroyed by Orcish siege engines during the sacking. Near the top of the gently sloped town is a large barracks and training ground. In the middle of the large training yard is a huge funeral pyre now covered with foliage. The skeletons are wearing plate armor with the symbol of Genesis emblazoned on them.
### Ileus's Childhood House
In a small house near the bottom wall of Mondrall, the players can find a very strong illusion spell covering the whole house. The outside of the house appears unchanged, but once the party steps inside, the entire interior is made to look like an idyllic snapshot of before the city was destroyed. Entering the house triggers the programmed illusion. It shows Ileus's parents finishing up preparing a meal, before calling Ileus ("Illy") down from his attic room. He comes down after a moment and the three sit down for a meal. Ileus's mom asks him what he was doing upstairs to which he responds that he was just looking at the stars again. His dad laughs and says that if he keeps using that telescope so much, they're gonna have to save up enough to buy him another one. After eating for a bit longer, Ileus puts down his utensils and asks his parents why they aren't allowed to go beyond the walls. His father responds that the world beyond the walls is wild and dangerous, and that there are monsters that are much more powerful than mere humans like themselves. His mother chimes in that they have everything they could ever need provided for them by Genesis, so why would they risk their lives beyond the walls. Ileus scoffs at this and proclaims that some day he is going to go exploring beyond those walls and is going to slay whatever mighty monsters might stand in his way. His dad reaches over and ruffles his hair and announces "Behold the mighty hero Ileus! Vanquisher of monsters and savior of Mankind!" The illusion then stops for a moment before resetting to its original state and playing out again.

If dispelled, there is a spot near the table where a spot of worn ground indicates that someone has stood there and done so many times.

Upstairs, Ileus has a lot of space paraphernalia, including a telescope and an orrery set to the position of Harmonic Alignment. The ceiling of his room is painted to look like the night sky, and it is actually an accurate model of the stars.

The eight founding members of the Anteity League were each masters in one of the eight schools of magic. All of them were taught by the gods themselves during the Great Dissension. In the years leading up to the Scourge, they abandoned the gods in order to form the Anteity League and challenge their former mentors and masters. The members of the Anteity League are also known as the Ancient Archmages, or at least the original Ancient Archmages, as all of them had apprentices who they fostered in hopes of strengthening the upholding of the Anteitic principles. Most of the apprentices died or were banished during the Scourge, but a few survived The Battle of the Planes, and lived on for years after the Dissension in secrecy and made sure that Arcana didn't die out with their masters.

Cavius
Cavius apprenticed under Ileus in the school of Illusion. He grew up in a small village on an island in the tropics of Chandaria (currently the Wildlands). Ileus found him while he was on the island studying displacer beasts. Cavius was known as a gifted learner around the island and had at a very young age began trading for books with merchants from neighboring islands. Ileus took Cavius under his wing and trained him in the art of Illusion. They travelled the world together, with Ileus teaching Cavius all his ways and indoctrinating him in the forming Anteitic principles. Cavius survived for about 30 years after the Dissension and used that time spreading what he considered to be the "correct" form of Arcana. He had modified what he was taught by Ileus and tried to focus on teaching it with a sense of altruism to try and avoid a multidimensional conflict again. Cavius died on his own accord without trying to reach lichdom like he suspected some of the other Ancient Archmages had done. Cavius always wore a Ring of Mindshielding to protect himself from various forms of illusion and enchantment magic. He never parted with his ring especially as he grew older and more paranoid that people were hunting him for his former allegiances. When he died wearing the ring, his soul was contained in the ring and from there on it changed hands many times, eventually ending up in Holfirth.

Ileus
Ileus was born in the pre-dissension city-state of Monfort. He was born before the Dissension. His parents were both very poor and he spent his childhood climbing across the rooftops of Monfort and looking beyond the wall, dreaming of exploring the boundless horizon he saw before him. When the Great Dissension started, he eagerly pledged his allegiance to Genesis in hopes of being able to see the world. Genesis magically prolonged the lives of all of her soldiers, so Ileus lived much longer than humans were meant to.  What he saw with his prolonged life changed him forever. He saw atrocities carried out in the name of the Gods, all of them, even his own Goddess, Genesis, the Goddess of Creation. Destruction in the name of creation, it made no sense to him. He saw all of the Gods as hypocrites. During the Great Dissension, Ileus served Genesis unfailingly. He had not yet become jaded yet. Genesis rewarded Ileus for his due service with great arcane knowledge. She taught him directly how to manipulate the weave to achieve whatever he wanted. As he grew more powerful as well as more skeptical of the Gods, he began to secretly spread the arcane knowledge he was granted, creating the first wave of Wizards. He also took the young boy Cavius under his wing as an apprentice, and began indoctrinating him with the same views as himself.

In secret, Ileus met with other powerful wizards in the service of the Gods of the Dissension. Together, they drafted the Anteitic Principles and formed the Anteity League. All of them shared Ileus's views that the Gods were tyrannical and that by killing them, mortals would be liberated and free. During the Divine Betrayal in the Battle for Caelum Insula, Ileus led the charge against the Gods along with his fellow Ancient Archmages and forced the Gods to retreat from Caelum Insula, with which the Scourge began.

At the climax of the Battle of Planes when the Ancient Archmages were banished, Ileus was banished to Carceri, where he spent 1,000 material years, which actually felt like 100,000 years for him, during which he didn’t age at all. After 100,000 years, Ileus eventually found Chaos's escape path from Carceri and followed it, escaping to the Astral Plane.

When the Ancient Archmages were banished, their souls were marked, and would alert the Gods if they ever entered the Material Plane again, after which the Gods would immediately smite them. Because of this, Ileus couldn't return to the Material Plane after escaping Carceri, so he instead travelled to an empty space in the Astral Sea and began shaping his own Demiplane. He spent the next 1,500 years building his lair on this demiplane, and also plotting his return to the Material Plane and the downfall of the Gods.

More Ileus Insight
During the Great Dissension, fighting was brought to the Opulent Steppe. An orc army in the service of Gruumsh marched across it, laying waste to once beautiful cities. People evacuated the cities of the Opulent Steppe in the wake of the incoming orc army. Later, when the forces of the upper planes came through, they found the cities ransacked.

In Monfort, Ileus found his neighborhood of poor people slaughtered. He found his parents' house destroyed with his parents dead inside.

He later learned that the Orcs had attacked Monfort because they found that Genesis's best soldiers were coming from there. This was his tipping point and was when he dedicated himself to the Anteity League.

Upon learning what happened to the Opulent Steppe after the Battle of the Planes, Ileus was furious that his homeland was destroyed. He took it as further proof that the gods need to be killed.

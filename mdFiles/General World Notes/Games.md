# Games
Games are a popular pastime for all manner of folk across [[Chandaria]]. Games are played in taverns, castle keeps, and hovels alike throughout the land. The popularity of games has also led to the rise of gambling. Gambling often happens in taverns, but it can also happen in more private areas too. Gambling however, is not legal across all of [[Chandaria]], with areas such as [[Luminespore Hollow]] in the [Larenthian Alliance](The%20Larenthian%20Alliance.md), and [[Marrisburg]] in [Falstor](The%20Kingdom%20of%20Falstor.md) outlawing gambling.
### Common Games
Common games across [[Chandaria]] include [[#Fiendish Fortune]], [[#3 Die Divination]], and [[#Scurvy Knave]].
##### Fiendish Fortune
Fiendish Fortune is a card game that originated among the dwarves in the mines of [[Essaheim]]. When playing the game, those who were very good at it were said to have struck a deal with a devil to have luck that rivalled that of [[Lucite]].
Fiendish Fortune involves both players placing down an equal ante. Once the antes are placed, each player draws three cards. This is simulated by the player rolling 3d6. The ranking of hands is as follows:
1. Three of a kind (Highest)
2. Straight
3. Flush (All even or all odd)
4. Pair
5. High Card (Lowest)
The player can place into the pot an additional amount of money equal to their ante to redraw (reroll) one card. The player with the higher hand wins all the money in the pot.

##### 3 Die Divination
This game originated in the halls of the Grand Halls of [Spellhaven](Valdens). It actually originated as an exercise in the Divination schools to teach students how to do simple prediction. Students then took the game and began spreading it on the streets in cities across [[Chandaria]], introducing the gambling aspect of the game.
The player bets any amount, chooses a number between 1 and 6. The dealer then rolls 3d6. If one die matches the player's number, they get their money back plus an equal amount. If two dice match the player's number, they get their money back plus double the amount. If three dice match the player's number, they get their money back plus triple the amount. And if none of the dice match, the dealer keeps the player's money.

##### Scurvy Knave
Scurvy Knave isn't as popular as the other two games, and is usually only played in gambling houses and casinos. It comes from the royal courts of [[No'zaral]]. The term "Scurvy Knave" referred to the flamboyant jesters who would challenge people in this game and take all of their money.
Scurvy Knave is a card game played with a 52 card deck. It involves a dealer and between 1 and 4 players. The game is played exactly like real-life [Blackjack](https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/how-to-play-blackjack/).

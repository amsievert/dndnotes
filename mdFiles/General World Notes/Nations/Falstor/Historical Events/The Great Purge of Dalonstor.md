# The Great Purge of Dalonstor
The Great Purge happened in 2479 PS, when members from the House Alystri crossed into the fishing waters claimed by the House Rocco, and were attacked on the water by soldiers from Rocco. The House Alystri claimed that the area that they had been in did not actually belong to Rocco, and was actually international waters. As soon as the House Alystri discovered that their ship had been attacked, they retaliated by making a house call to Rocco and torching part of the Rocco manor. During the fight, a number of the Alystri attackers were killed. Rocco went on a counter attack and began killing anyone in the street that they saw wearing the Alystri crest. Martial Law was declared in the city for 3 days as the fighting continued in the streets. At the end of the battle, there was only one survivor from the House Alystri, Sylas, who lived in a house off the Alystri grounds and fended off a group of Rocco soldiers by himself. He made his way to a safehouse and hunkered down, until the House Rocco believed that Alystri was completely eliminated. Eventually, Sylas rebuilt the House Alystri to its former strength.

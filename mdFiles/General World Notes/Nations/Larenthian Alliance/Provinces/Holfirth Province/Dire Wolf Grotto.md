Dire Wolf Grotto is a harvesting town that focuses on capturing, raising, and harvesting the dire wolves from the Shadowwood Forest. The village has around 50 people that live in the town center and surrounding areas. Some say that the day that the wolf pens of Dire Wolf Grotto go silent, the province will collapse. The local archive, The Lupine Archives, keeps texts on business dealings, local legends, and harvesting standards among other things.

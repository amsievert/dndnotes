Seldoris is the realm of all of the elves that live on Arvandor in Arborea. It's name is derived from the [[Seldori]], who are the half-divine children of Harmonia. The region is known for its massive swaths of wilderness and diverse megafauna. Forests with trees taller than redwoods have multiple ecosystems in different canopy levels. At points, the forest floor can be so full with vegetation that it can be completely unpassable.

Spread across the massive wilderness are different settlements of elves. The distance between them is so far at certain points that it is considered impossible to travel on foot between the settlements, and portals must be used.
### Geography
The swaths of wilderness in Seldoris are among the most pristine and untouched natural beauties. Among its features are lush forests, massive mountains, perfectly clear streams, calm lakes, and a vast ocean called the Sparkling Sea. The realm stretches from the Sparkling Sea to the mountains just beyond Aubade Palace. On the other axis is its hotly contested border with Olympia.

The deep woods of Seldoris are so dense that it can seem almost unnatural. The otherworldly beauty of the land is said to exemplify the nature of the Elves that inhabit the realm. In the same way, it is also said that the land was influenced by the Elves whose energy turned the wilderness even more intense and chaotic.

In its thickest parts, the forests are made of multiple layers, with trees growing on top of other trees. The top layer was home to sun-loving trees, while below that a layer of vegetation thrived in the shade. All the way down, the forest floor was so dense with dead trees and vegetation that it is nearly unpassable, even for the elves.

Seldoris has more than just forests. The chaotic forests are offset by wide open meadows flush with perennial flowers that have grown for many years, some of them even decades.

The energy and passion of Arborea can be overwhelming for non-elven travelers, causing them to break out into hysterical singing and dancing. Even half-elves aren't entirely immune to this effect.
### Government
As the plane's chaotic good alignment suggests, government is not very important to the Seldori. However, the realm is not total anarchy. The Seldori quickly realized the need for some sort of way to enforce their rule. The Seldori appointed High Kings and Queens to enforce their rule on across the realm.
### Trade
The different kingdoms within Seldoris rarely trade with each other, since the knowledge of the arts is intrinsic to all of the Elves in Seldoris. Furthermore, due to the relative abundance of resources in Seldoris, each kingdom has the capacity to create most goods.

Instead, most of the trade in Seldoris happens between Elven artisans and interplanar merchants. The goods made in Seldoris are finer quality than almost any others in the universe. The mead is sweeter than any other, the meat juicier than any other, and the instruments sing so clear that they can be heard for miles. Even the Elves of [[Tilarien]] are jealous of the craftsmanship that the Seldori are capable of. Seldori crafts are among the most expensive across the planes because of their premium quality.
### Defenses
There are many portals throughout Seldoris that lead to different planes, many to Sigil and the Outlands. However, there are some portals that lead to Gehenna, where the evil forces of [[Yurk]] sometimes try to invade Seldoris. These hostile portals are well guarded by Seldori forces and are kept secure at all times.

Besides extraplanar threats, the people of Seldoris also need to defend themselves from their neighbors. There are Seldori outposts all along the Olympian border, where the Elves patrol constantly on the lookout for Olympian monsters wandering too far into Seldoris. Due to the Elves' superior manufacturing and tactics, the Olympian monsters have never made much progress.
### History
Harmonia settled in Arborea in the years following the Fracture. As she regained her power, she unintentionally shaped the plane with her energy. Especially in the area that would eventually become Seldoris, the land became shaped by her essence. She built her palace and lived on Arvandor alone for many years, perfecting the arts.

The Olympian Gods moved in next, striking up a deal with Harmonia to split Arvandor into two realms. Soon after this split, a group of proto-elves made their way to Arvandor and were welcomed into Harmonia's realm. The proto-elves got along very well with Harmonia because of their affinity for the arts.

With the proto-elves now living in Harmonia's realm, they created the Seldori, half-divine children of Harmonia and different proto-elves. Harmonia granted her children settlements across her realm, which led to it coming to be known as Seldoris.

During the Scourge, the Olympian Gods were killed, and their realm fell silent, while Seldoris continued to grow and thrive.
### Notable Locations
#### Ingmar Brook
The Ingmar Brook flows away from the Sparkling Sea and eventually crosses over into Alfheim in Ysgard. The river is used by traders and merchants to trade between the two realms. At its widest, the river is about 30 feet wide, allowing medium-sized vessels to travel on it, but preventing any sort of warship from using the river. Nonetheless, the river is patrolled by a joint force of Sea and Wood Elves to prevent any Olympian incursions or Ysgardian aggression.
#### Sleeping Giant's Hill
This large hill is said to actually be a sleeping giant covered in earth and grass. Storytellers can't seem to agree exactly where the alleged giant came from, whether it was from Olympia or Ysgard. Some tell cautionary tales about the giant one day waking and laying waste to Seldoris.
#### Sparkling Sea
The Sparkling Sea is home to [[Seldori|Vaprana]] and her host of Sea Elves, as well as many different aquatic creatures. It is not uncommon to see the Sea Elves swimming alongside schools of fish or riding on the backs of giant dolphins as they patrol the Sea and hunt for food. While the Sparkling Sea appears to have a far coast, no one has ever reached it before, so nothing is known about what's on the far side of the Sea.
#### Sea Elf Grotto
While it may have once been small like a typical Grotto, this settlement has since expanded to be quite large. It consists of a smaller land settlement where the non-aquatic inhabitants live, and an expansive underwater settlement on the side of an underwater cliff where the majority of the population lives, along with [[Seldori|Vaprana]] and her palace.
#### Silverflow River
This is the main river that supplies water to the entire realm. It flows from the Sparkling Sea all the way across the landscape to the Misty Lake beneath Aubade Palace. It splits in many places, becoming the Ingmar Brook, Lothlorn River, and even pooling in Lake Taesi. Besides being a water source, the river also serves as the only other reliable method of travel across Seldoris besides the portals.
#### Lake Taesi
This lake serves as the peaceful backdrop to the Seldori High Elf Hanir's estate. It is home to many peaceful creatures and always has a glassy surface, protected from wind by the massive trees that grow around the coast.
#### Hanir's Manor
The Seldori High Elf Hanir, one of Harmonia's children, lives in a lavish mansion on the coast of Lake Taesi. The Manor is made mostly of wood and has acres of gardens planted on the grounds. On one corner of the manor is a stone brick tower that protrudes from the roof of the building. The tower is almost tall enough to peer above the massive Arborean trees.
#### Lolth's Grove
Lolth's Grove is a dense thicket of trees that shade their Drow inhabitants from the blazing Valos sun. Many Drow live in small settlements here, shaded from the sun, where they most remain sequestered from the rest of Seldoris.
#### Lake Goneril
Not many travel to Lake Goneril. Surrounding its coast and in the water are many bodies from a large battle between Seldoris forces and the Olympians. The whole place stinks of death and a low fog hangs over the lake at all times.
#### Grandfather Oak
This tree is often called the mini World Tree of Arborea. In the limbs of this massive oak tree are many portals that lead all around Seldoris. It acts as a travel hub for those moving across the realm.

Besides being a travel hub, Grandfather Oak is also the main settlement for Esylra and her Wood Elves. They live in small cottages built in the canopies, while Esylra has a bigger house built near the top canopy.
#### Aubade Palace
Above the Misty Lake, perched atop a large cloud bank is a glittering palace. This is the realm of the Eladrin, led by the Seldori Eladrin Siedus.

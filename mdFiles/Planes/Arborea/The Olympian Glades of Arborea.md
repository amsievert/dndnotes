The Olympian Glades of Arborea, more commonly referred to as simply Arborea, is the plane that represents the Chaotic Good alignment in the planar cosmology. It is a plane of great, heightened emotion. It is home to creatures both boisterous and larger than life. The plane is known most for its top layer that is covered in massive, untamed wilderness.

The plane was also the home to a pantheon of minor Gods that were completely destroyed during the [[The Great Dissension#The Scourge|Scourge]]. The names of these Gods have long been lost to time, but their domain, Olympia, still resides on the top layer of Arborea, and still partially lends its name to Arborea's full title.
## Geography
When most picture Arborea, they picture the top layer, Arvandor, which is where a large majority of the plane's inhabitants reside. Like the intense emotions that are prevalent throughout Arborea, the plane's geography is volatile and extreme. There are massive forests, never-ending plains, and towering mountains.

Many Arboreans imagine the weather as the manifestation of the plane's emotions. In much the same way as the rest of the plane, the weather is incredibly volatile, swinging from gentle to gale force wind and back in matters of minutes. In this sense, the Arborean wilderness can be quite dangerous. Unprepared adventurers can quickly be killed by a stray pocket of extreme weather.

Settlements in Arborea are sparse, but not because they are few in number. Rather, the plane is so large that travelling on foot between settlements could take months. Accordingly, the main form of transportation across the plane is by portal. These settlements shelter their denizens from the intense weather that presents the main threat throughout the plane.
### Layers
There are three layers on Arborea. The top layer is the most well-known and is what most people picture when they think of Arborea. The bottom two have very few inhabitants and are difficult to get to, with not much reason to do so regardless.
#### Arvandor
Arvandor is a patchwork domain of different biomes, each taken to their extreme. Massive forests of towering trees lead up the slopes of mountains that protrude well above the clouds, which then give way to never-ending plains. All of Arvandor is incredibly abundant with food and resources. Every fruit and vegetable that grows here is huge and much more nutritious compared to its Material Plane counterpart. Likewise, the animals that roam the wilderness of Arvandor are larger than even dire beasts of the Material Plane.

Arvandor is split into two distinct realms, Seldoris and the ruins of Olympia. Seldoris is the realm of Elves and Eladrin, many with connections to prehistoric [[Tilarien]]. Olympia was the realm of the Olympian pantheon, who were all killed during the Scourge, their names long since forgotten and their power gone. These days, Olympia is nothing but ruins, fragments of memories of a grand civilization.

Olympia is home to many monsters like Gorgons, Medusae, Cyclopes, and Chimeras. These monsters are said to be children of the dead Olympians that were left behind when their parents died. Seldoris on the other hand is home to the massive beasts that Arvandor is known for.

Because of Harmonia's domain in Seldoris, her presence can be felt across Arvandor. It is said that the air seems to crackle with energy when one breathes it in. This energy is thought to be a manifestation of the intense emotion that overcomes those on the plane.
#### Aquallor
At first glance, Aquallor seems very similar to the Elemental Plane of Water, or Thalasia in Elysium. However, it has one glaring difference: this endless expanse of water is only about three feet deep across the entire layer. Despite this, deadly maelstroms can still spring up out of nowhere, making this layer still incredibly dangerous to cross on foot.

Across Aquallor, there are unfathomably deep ravines that carve their way through the shallow ocean floor. These crags are home to deep sea monsters, as well as settlements of sea elves. On top of the water, there are ships and a small number of floating cities that ride the gentle waves of Aquallor.
#### Mithardir
The elven word Mithardir most closely translates to "white dust" in the Common tongue. This is a very apt description of the bottom layer of Arborea. The layer is said to be dying, and is made up of nothing but endless deserts of sand, snow, and ash that blows in strong gusts. There are no known notable settlements on this layer. There are ruins of settlements half-buried in the dust, but almost nothing is known of what these ancient cities were or who inhabited them.

The prevalent theory for an explanation of Mithardir is that, much like Olympia on Arvandor, the deity that called Mithardir their domain died during the Scourge. As faith in this God died out along with their existing followers, their power has waned, which led to their domain, Mithardir, crumbling into oblivion.
## Inhabitants
Despite their often reckless emotion, the denizens of Arborea are mostly good in alignment and dedicated to fighting evil. Many of the humanoid inhabitants were once great mortal heroes who led lives of unrestrained passion and emotion. Likewise, the Olympian monsters that are said to be descendants of the dead Gods, still live hedonistic lives.
### Elves and Their Descendants
While the elves as a race were created by Genesis during her construction of the universe, they often trace a lot more of their ancestry to [[Harmonia]] and the [[Seldoris|Seldori]]. The Seldori are the progenitors of the different elvenkind races (Elves, Drow, Eladrin, Sea Elves), born from the union between the proto-elves and Harmonia.

The Elves have inhabited Seldoris for many millennia, even longer than they have lived on Tilarien. In Seldoris, they live in different settlements spread throughout the vast wilderness. In the center of Seldoris is Harmonia's Tower, where all of the elves and Seldori intermingle and meet with each other.
### Olympian Monsters
The Olympian monsters are thought to be loose descendants of the old Olympian Gods. They are embodiments of the Chaotic nature of the plane, having absolutely no regard for law or order of any kind. Not happy with their own realm, they are constantly attempting to invade Arvandor and take over the much nicer elven land. However, the elves are much superior in their technology and tactics, and have been able to repel the monsters since their first attack.
### Celestials
Being an upper plane, Arborea is home to many different types of celestials. While they don't have a specific place where they live, these celestials are mixed in with all the other populations that live on Arborea. These celestials uphold the true good nature of the plane. Some of the celestials band together with those hot-headed mortal heroes to continue the good fight against the Olympian monsters on Seldoris' borders.
### Gods
Both Harmonia and Valos live in Arborea. Harmonia rules over her domain from her tower at the center of Seldoris. From there, she indulges in the arts with her Seldori children and their elven descendants. Her palace is known far and wide for putting on the best theater performances and the best concerts. Folk travel from across the planes with the hopes of attending a performance at Harmonia's tower. As a remnant of the Fracture, the air on Arvandor seems to crackle with energy, the weave being even more powerful here than on any other plane.

Valos doesn't have a specific domain on Arborea, but rather he travels across all of the layers, providing light and protection to them. It is said that when he leaves a layer to travel to the next, that layer enters its nighttime until he returns again for the next day. The warmth of his light bathes all of the plane in beautiful sunlight, as he travels across the sky in radiant beauty.

The Gods of the Olympian Pantheon were minor deities that existed before [[The Great Dissension#The Scourge|the Scourge]]. The entire pantheon was killed by the Anteity League during the Scourge, and the names of all its Gods have long been lost to time. Like the [[Gods and Mythos|Aeonic Pantheon]], it's unsure exactly when this pantheon came to be in the Universe. Some theologists theorized that the Olympians could have come from a different Multiverse.

Regardless of their origin, they settled in Arborea alongside [[Harmonia]] and her [[Seldori]] after many years of wandering the Planes. For the most part, the Olympians got along amicably with [[Harmonia]], and the two forces divided Arvandor into their own realms of [[Seldoris]] and Olympia.

The Olympian Gods were nowhere near as powerful as the [[Gods and Mythos|Aeonic Pantheon]]. Because of this, the descendants of the Olympians are seen across the planes as monstrosities. This monstrous opinion was only exacerbated after the death of the Pantheon. Upon losing their divinity, the Olympian descendants' bodies and minds deteriorated, turning them into true monsters. The planes are now plagued with Cyclopes, Medusae, Gorgons, and many more Olympian monsters.

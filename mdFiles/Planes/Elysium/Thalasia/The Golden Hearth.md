Perched atop the tallest island in [[Thalasia]], [[Cielia|Cielia's]] palace sits among the clouds, visible to the entire layer. It is fittingly known as the Golden Hearth. The towering palace is covered with greenery. Vines, rooftop gardens, and all manner of foliage blanket the building, while sparkling gold shines through the gaps, bathing everything in a golden light. The roof of the palace has spires that shoot into the sky, topped with bulbs that resemble flower buds.

The throne room is expansive, with golden pillars that hold aloft a domed ceiling with beautiful murals across it. [[Cielia|Cielia's]] throne, which is made of foliage itself, sits at the center of the room, allowing a view out the front door that allows her to watch over the entire plane.

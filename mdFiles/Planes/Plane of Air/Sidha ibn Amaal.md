Sidha ibn Amaal was the Grand Caliph of the Djinn Caliphate during the [[The Great Dissension|Great Dissension]]. The Djinni fought alongside Tiamat during the Dissension, which is part of the reason why the [[The Great Serpents|Great Serpents]] became the protectors of the Elemental Planes after the war. Grand Caliph Sidha worked very hard to keep a tenuous relationship with Tiamat from boiling over. She also kept the Djinni of the Caliphate in line during a time when they wanted nothing more than to break apart and form their own realms.

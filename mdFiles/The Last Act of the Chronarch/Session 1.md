Current Day:  14th of Aestia, 2511 PS

To Clint: "Heat … light … your consciousness slowly becomes aware of a great warm light that flickers beyond your closed eyelids. The light and heat grow so intense that they become almost stifling, sucking the air out of your chest. Your body reflexively shifts due to the discomfort. You suddenly realize what the crushing weight really is. Your eyes shoot open and you take in the sight around you. You lie in the study of your small house, the room encompassed in bright flames that engulf the walls of books and lick at the ceiling. Black smoke chokes your lungs and burns your eyes. A thick wooden beam from the roof lays across your torso, crushing your chest and squeezing the air out of your lungs. You reach up to your head and feel warm blood smeared across your brow. Looking back to the wooden beam, you see tongues of flame quickly climbing across the wood towards you."

He must make a DC10 athletics or acrobatics check to escape from the rubble and collect any last items from his house before it burns down.

Outside: "It seems as if all the fires of the Nine Hells have descended upon the city of Spellhaven. Large plumes of smoke climb high into the summer night sky, blocking out the usual twinkling starlight. Despite the lack of light from the stars, the city is bathed in orange light from countless large fires that burn throughout the city's wards. You see crowds of panicked citizens run past, heading towards the center of the city. Knowing the city, you can assume that they are headed towards the Lansen Memorial Nexus in the primary ward."

Clint is free to go where he wants from here, follow or not.

PAN UP TO SKY AND PAN BACK DOWN FOCUSED ON EXTERIOR OF SMALL POTION SHOP

We go now to a small potion shop. A large wooden sign painted to look like a beaker sits crooked atop the shingle roof. The front of the building has a single door next to a large display window. The

To Barb and Rango: "Potions rattle on the shelves. The soft tinkle of glass rings throughout the shop, drowning out the muffled chaos from outside. Behind a counter, next to a bin of random potions labelled 'Barb's Bargain Bin', stands a buff barbarian woman." (Barb describes character). "Across the counter in front of Barb stands a tall Lizard man who seems absolutely determined to learn more about potions relating to something called Elderbark Trees." (Rango describes character). *Open to some roleplay here about the potions*

After a bit of back and forth, a bright light flashes outside, casting harsh shadows across the shop. The bright flash is immediately followed by a thunderous boom. With another cacophonous crash, the front window to the shop explodes in a cloud of shattered glass. A small 3 foot creature tumbles across the ground, thrown with a great deal of force, toppling over a few of the potion shelves. It stands up on spindly legs and swings its long clawed arms around wildly. It glances at the two characters with a burning stare and bears its fangs through a lipless smile."

Simple combat ensues.

Afterwards: "You look out through the broken window and see the city in flames. The starry night sky has been replaced by the twinkling glitter of large circular portals that are open across the night sky. Monstrous aberrations pour out of the portals, swarming the sky. Back on the ground outside the shop, a SCMM officer amplifies his voice and shouts, 'Citizens of Spellhaven, please evacuate to the Godrick Lansen Memorial Nexus in the center of the city. Once you are in Sigil, you will be able to -' his speech gets cut off as a crackling bolt of energy strikes him in the chest. The bolt came from a Red-Robed Mage wearing a white mask on top of a nearby roof."

Barb and Rango can do what they want now (Hopefully they choose to go to the Nexus).

Regardless of where they go, they run into Clint. The three of them collide and Clint is knocked over by them. Nearby they hear someone shouting "Get out of here. Get off me." A bard nearby stands atop a busking box. They are kicking away two more of the star spawn grues that are chewing at their madnolin and trying to climb the box. (Nat describes character). Hopefully the party helps. At the same time, a drunken Aasimar stumbles out of a bar on the corner and joins in the fight. (Anya describes Character).

Whenever they move next they eventually pass by a temple, Yorik stands outside beckoning people in that are wounded. Hopefully the party is wounded and wants some heals, of which there are plenty in the temple. For now, Nathan's character is also in the temple availing of the healing supplies. After a brief respite, another member of the Temple, Sir Jorik, approaches the party. He tells them that they should lead a party of the citizens to the Nexus.

If the party ever tries to get into the primary ward to get to the Nexus, they are stopped at the gates by SCMM guards. They are stopping people from getting in because the Nexus is currently being overloaded and they need to control the crowds. As they talk, an elite mage comes through escorted by bodyguards and is let through with no issue.

After guard roleplay, the other guards turn around shocked as a Tarrasque stomps towards the Volantrum, crushing buildings underfoot. It jumps up and sinks its claws into the floating rock. The levitation magic buckles under the weight of the Tarrasque and the Volantrum strains against invisible constraints momentarily before breaking loose. The Tarrasque hangs off the side as it falls from the sky, slamming into the ground in a giants plume of dirt and rock. The last thing seen before the cloud engulfs everything is the iconic spire of the Crystal Forums cracking from the impact and shattering.

All of the people by the gate pause in momentary shock before turning and running the other way. The guards shout behind them to head for the edge of the city and take the Arcane Byways to the outer towns.

Encounters:
C/R - The party encounters a Githzerai Monk and a gazer that is following it. I can't think of any ways this could end up without combat but I'm always open.

R - 2 bandits named Steven and Clyde ambush the party from an alley. They jump out but are immediately taken aback by how many members of the party there are. They sheepishly apologize and try to talk their way out of the situation.

R - A bard named Mero stands perched atop a house and plays a sad song on his violin. He claims that someday, someone will tell stories about how Mero fiddled as Spellhaven burned.

MAYBE SKIP THIS ONE? Once the party reaches the wall splitting the secondary and tertiary wards, they are ushered inside the battlements. The guards there inform them that most of the SCMM are dead or are in the primary ring fighting the main force, and they need people to man the arcane battery cannons here on the wall. There are enough cannons for everyone to use. The cannons have a +6 to hit and deal 8d10 force damage on a hit. The party is tasked with defending the gates and keeping them open for other citizens to evacuate through. The gate is set upon by many more powerful creatures like mind flayers and red dragons. Eventually they get overwhelmed and the Chronarch opens a portal and insists that they go through.

If the party chooses not to defend the gates, they are set upon by an army of commoners that are under the control of some nearby mind flayers. The commoners just keep swarming them until they are overwhelmed and the Chronarch casts a time stop and gets them all to travel through the portal to safety.

MEETING WITH THE CHRONARCH
The Chronarch wears an emerald green cloak and the face of it is always shrouded in magical darkness. He is clearly injured however, as a dark crimson stain is slowly spreading across the front of his robe. As he talks, he coughs and spits blood down the front of his robe.

He tells the party who he is and how he has the ability to control time to a certain extent. He has been trying to stop this catastrophe but failed. He wasn't able to warn anyone because a member of the Octoclave, Tanaeus Lysander would silence him whenever he tried. He then shares that Tanaeus was the one who started this apocalypse. He is going to send the party back in time to stop Tanaeus and succeed where he couldn't. He leaves them with one final cryptic clue: "When the resurgent goddess dons her verdant veil, a hand once scorned convenes in solemnity to avenge the transgressions of the past. Seek the seal from creation, for only in the unbinding of its secrets does the future's salvation await, hidden in the hour when memory meets oblivion."

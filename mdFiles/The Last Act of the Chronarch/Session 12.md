Current Day: 22nd of Florum, 2506 PS

Possible Paths:
Investigating Bearclaw Distillery:
The Bearclaw Distillery also acts as a store. It's the only place to get bottles like the one that Lars had. The worker at the front has no idea about the bottle, but with some pressure can get the party an audience with the manager of the distillery. The manager, Phil McHenry, denies having any connection to the murder. A DC 10 perception/arcana check reveals that Phil is covered with a disguise self spell. The spell is only altering his face, which underneath has a black eye and a big bruise on his cheek. With some convincing, he admits that there was a shady individual that came around a few days ago asking about what kind of whiskey that Lars liked to drink. When Phil refused, the shady character beat him pretty bad until he gave in.

Investigating the Thieves Guild:
The Thieves Guild will be pretty hard to investigate, since the Guild knows all of the party members are associated with the theft of the scroll. If any of the party members are seen in the Guild hall, the guards attempt to apprehend them and interrogate them. Asking why they stole the scroll and who they are working for. The NPCs in the Guild Hall are half Spy stat blocks and half Thug stat blocks. Any of the named NPCs are Master Thief stat blocks. In terms of clues, in the alchemy lab, a ledger shows that someone named Cel ordered Purple Worm Poison on the 15th of Florum. Also, in the leader's office, Tony keeps a list of all incoming correspondence, which shows that a Councilman named Seris Durn ordered the assassination of Lars on the 10th of Florum.

Investigating Erin Tachne:
A meeting can be set up with Erin, just like any of the other Council members. She is a very shrewd politician who is very blunt and pragmatic, which can come off cold. However, she is not an evil person, and is not the killer. The only information that she can provide for the investigation is background on the deal with Spellhaven. She knows that the Spellhaven mages are giving the city shipments of Harmonium, as well as blueprints for cutting edge arcane technology. She also reveals that Lars was recently spending a lot of time with council members Seris Durn, and Greta Stonechild.

Resolution:
Once a suspect is found, they can be reported to the No'zaral overseers, since they work independently of the city's authority. They work instead for the Free Congress of No'zaral, and will arrest the suspect.

If the party ever leaves Lanbruk, they encounter a checkpoint where members of the Crimson Brand ask if they have any maps or books related to the Westerwood or the Elderbark trees.

Lanbruk Inhabitants:
Mayor: Kiri Lanorys (Female Tiefling)
Blacksmith: Dreok Hammerfist (Male Dwarf)
Innkeeper: Aylward Grassel (Male Half-Elf)
Carpenter: Eberdeb Stumpydump (Female Gnome)
Cowherd: Grum Stamling (Male Human)
Farmer: Stephen Osmer (Male Half-Elf)

A little over half a day's travel south of Lanbruk, before the Mercenary Camp is a short cutoff that leads to another small village named Pylatel. This village sits in the bend of a small river, which makes it very defensible. Pylatel is entrenched in defenses like a siege. The village has a small library that allegedly has some books about the Elderbark trees and their known locations. This is why the Crimson Brand is attacking the village.

About 30 miles south of Lanbruk is Welbenwallow. Welbenwallow is a small city / large town. About 20,000 people packed into a tight walled city that sits perched on top of a small hill. The walls of the city are segmented into plates of stone brick that are constantly shifting and protecting damaged plates. The walls also have devices on the top called Spellkillers which activate antimagic auras on the walls, preventing spells and teleportation. Inside the city are crowded streets loomed over by tall buildings. High above the streets, cable cars carry people among the rooftop society. On the streets, large walking automatons called Striders carry pedestrians to their destinations.

In Welbenwallow, the Hall of Records holds most of the city's knowledge and patents. The center of the city is a park called the Perpetual Plaza. The Hall of Records and the capitol building, The Consortium Spire, are both on the sides of the Perpetual Plaza. In the center of the Perpetual Plaza is a statue of a Rube Goldberg-like perpetual motion machine.

Reborn Forest: Part of the Westerwood that was heavily deforested during the Arcane Resurgence. Many druids worked very hard to replant the region and grow it back to its former glory.

Welbenwallow notes:
Essentially ruled by the Clockwork Consortium. Automatons called striders patrol the streets and help citizens carry things. There are all sorts of clockwork machines around the city.

Hidden beneath the hill that the city rests upon is an elevator-like machine that when activated will raise the city high into the air in the case of a siege or attack. This is a VERY well-guarded secret only known to the top officials in the city.

Underneath the city is also the Harmonium Reactor that powers the whole city with Harmonium.

Pylatel Inhabitants:
Mayor: Thelonius (Male Halfling)
Druid: Bramble Stamp (Female Elf)
Innkeeper: Olga Vetrya (Female Goliath)

Possible Questlines:
- After retrieving Aylward's son, he offers to put in a good word for the party with Thelonius, the mayor of Pylatel. They used to be friends back in the day.
- At the Crimson Brand's camp north of Welbenwallow, they constantly send out groups of scouts to look for Elderbark trees. The leader is Elminster Lysander (half-elf mage), the brother of Tanaeus.
- In Pylatel, the mayor Thelonius asks the party to check up on the local druid who lives at the edge of town. The druid's name is Bramble, and she is an elderly elf. In her hut is the scene of a struggle. Two dead goblins and objects everywhere. There are scratch marks and a set of tracks that appear to be some sort of badger or bobcat or raccoon that lead out the back of the house.
	- While tracking, the party encounters a sentient tree that witnessed a "mossy one" being chased by three "desecrators" heading towards the "scar". Up ahead they find a spot where it looks like Bramble was caught.
	- Further on is a quarry site where Crimson Brand mercenaries are drilling around a thick elderbark tree. There are a few prisoners held here including Bramble and 4 thugs, 4 goblins, and a hobgoblin captain.

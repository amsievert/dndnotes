Current Day: 7th of Florum, 2506 PS

As the party travels south along the road, they come across a dwarf wearing overalls, sitting against a cart taking a nap. He is dozing off with a pickaxe leaned against the cart next to him. Inside the cart are more digging tools and some light explosives. The dwarf's name is Torgus and he explains that he works for a miner's guild that was contracted to do some prospecting work. He doesn't know any more about the intricacies of the contract, he just likes digging and blowing stuff up. In reality, the guild was hired by the Crimson Brand to open up the roots of the nearby Elderbark tree.

Books in the Pylatel Library:
A Firsthand Account From Pylaxes (Excerpt from Heroes of Thalasia)
On The History of the Westerwood and the Nature of the Elderbark Trees

Upon approaching Pylatel, it is very clear that the city is under siege in some capacity. There are broken down siege engines in the fields outside of the wooden palisade. The guards at the gate are very skeptical of the group.

Periodically while in Pylatel, the ground shakes with a mini earthquake. Thelonius fears that it is forest spirits mad and has something to do with Bramble the druid.

The Inn's name is River Bend Brandy.

In the center of town is a statue of Pylaxes. The villagers are well acquainted with his deeds.

Pylatel Inhabitants:
Mayor: Thelonius (Male Halfling)
Druid: Bramble Stamp (Female Elf)
Innkeeper: Olga Vetrya (Female Goliath)
Librarian: Chuck (Male Halfling - Brother of Thelonius)

- In Pylatel, the mayor Thelonius asks the party to check up on the local druid who lives at the edge of town. The druid's name is Bramble, and she is an elderly elf. In her hut is the scene of a struggle. Two dead goblins and objects everywhere. There are scratch marks and a set of tracks that appear to be some sort of badger or bobcat or raccoon that lead out the back of the house.
	- While tracking, the party encounters a sentient tree that witnessed a "mossy one" being chased by three "desecrators" heading towards the "scar". Up ahead they find a spot where it looks like Bramble was caught.
	- Further on is a quarry site where Crimson Brand mercenaries are drilling around a thick elderbark tree. There are a few prisoners held here including Bramble and 4 thugs, 4 goblins, and a hobgoblin captain.

Current Day: 9th of Florum, 2506 PS

The party wakes up after their night of sleep in the River Bend Brandy Inn. They can visit Chuck at the library any time and he will give them access to the protected texts of the library: a partial map of all the known Elderbark trees and an original text from written by Ysaldan Vhal (Wizard from Arcane Resurgence) that has strange markings in the margins and a note at the end written in Draconic.

If no one knows Draconic, Chuck says that he knows that a librarian named Esther in Welbenwallow knows how to translate Draconic. He is nervous about the party taking the original manuscript or even a copy. If the Crimson Brand gets their hands on this map, even partial, there is no telling what they might do with it.

Whenever the party leaves Pylatel, they see the formings of a siege camp being built in the trees just beyond the open field outside of the village. There are about 15 soldiers there right now, and it looks as if they are new recruits to the Crimson Brand. The siege camp is not on the road and the party can leave if they want.

The Crimson Brand's plan to attack the town this town involves a two-pronged attack. They are going to attack the damaged section of the wall from the front mainly with new recruits as fodder. The other detachment has stashed gliders along the cliffs across the river and are going to glide across the river and attack the town from behind simultaneously. There are about 50 soldiers in the front and about 20 more elite soldier along the cliffs.

Along the road towards Welbenwallow, there is a checkpoint run by a joint force of Crimson Brand mercenaries and Welbenwallow city guards. They ask the party what their business is traveling to Welbenwallow and ask to search their belongings for contraband. They are really just looking for anything related to the Elderbark trees.

In Welbenwallow, Esther works at a library called Tomes GaLore. She is fairly busy and asks if the party can wait until night time so they can talk over a nice dinner out on the town. She can answer a few more questions about Pylith and can help the party find the poorly translated version of the Ysaldan manuscript.

The other map piece is located in the ruins of Pylith.

During the Arcane Resurgence, the mages that were studying the Elderbark trees discovered their connection to the Interplanar Fabric. Through their research, they discovered a way to travel the roots of the trees to travel to other planes. A mage named Ysaldan Vhal traveled to the edge of the Astral Plane (the Primordial Fringe) and retrieved a piece of matter that was a piece of the void that existed before the creation of the universe. With this she crafted the Void Seal, a powerful antimagic device.

Ysaldan hid the void seal in a special facility to keep it safe and further research its effects. This facility is hidden deep in the forests of Chandaria's west coast. Ysaldan marked down its location in some of her original writings, using the locations of the Elderbark trees as the points in a sigil that shows the location of the facility.

The Crimson Brand has a paraphrased version of one of these writings and believes that the facility is deep beneath one of the Elderbark trees, rather than located in relation to the trees.

About 30 miles south of Lanbruk is Welbenwallow. Welbenwallow is a small city / large town. About 20,000 people packed into a tight walled city that sits perched on top of a small hill. The walls of the city are segmented into plates of stone brick that are constantly shifting and protecting damaged plates. The walls also have devices on the top called Spellkillers which activate antimagic auras on the walls, preventing spells and teleportation. Inside the city are crowded streets loomed over by tall buildings. High above the streets, cable cars carry people among the rooftop society. On the streets, large walking automatons called Striders carry pedestrians to their destinations.

In Welbenwallow, the Hall of Records holds most of the city's knowledge and patents. The center of the city is a park called the Perpetual Plaza. The Hall of Records and the capitol building, The Consortium Spire, are both on the sides of the Perpetual Plaza. In the center of the Perpetual Plaza is a statue of a Rube Goldberg-like perpetual motion machine.

The guards of Welbenwallow use clockwork devices to assist them. They are known as the Bronzewardens, but many just call them the Brass. Many of them have Modrons that follow them around.

Encounters on the way to Pylith:
A roadside gambler named Phil who offers to play any of the dnd games with the party.
A hidden stash of 1d4 level 1 spell scrolls.
A green dragon wyrmling with a single cult fanatic that are trying to start a new cult. They accost the party asking for valuables or if they want to join.

Political Situation in Welbenwallow:
Unable to operate in the Welbenwallow province legally, the mages of Spellhaven approached the Clockwork Consortium with a proposition. They offered to share advanced arcano-tech blueprints, exclusive magical research data, and harmonium crystal supplies with the city. The vote to accept the deal narrowly passed. The Spellhaven mages hired the Crimson Brand, a local mercenary company with established connections in the province to help them.

Many suspect that there were many shady deals and bribes that allowed the vote to pass. There is a small group of Consortium politicians that are very upset with the deal and are trying to find ways to revoke the Crimson Brand's exploratory license.

Pylith:
A small cabal of dragons, holding the grudge from the age of dragons destroyed Pylith during the Astral Devastation.

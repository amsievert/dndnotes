Current Day: 11th of Florum, 2506 PS

Political Questline:
Esther knows 2 politicians that are the de facto leaders of the small faction of people against the Spellhaven mages. Their names are Lars Kline and Meriel Daes. The political faction they lead is known as the Wolves. There are about 10 politicians of the 150 on the Welbenwallow Council that support the Wolves. The Wolves' current goal is to find evidence that the Spellhaven mages bribed the Council members, and to show that evidence to the Free Congress, the governing body of No'Zaral. Most of the Council members likely keep records of their finances in their manors, especially the Council treasurer, Reubyn Elran.

Councilman Elran's manor is in the Skyward District, the top layer of the city where the cable cars transport people between fancy houses. Elran's Manor takes up an entire city block and has artificial trees and hedges that give the illusion of a grandiose courtyard in front of the house. He has private security that guard the manor around the clock. The only way to get to the manor are through the cable car checkpoints.

Inside the manor, the sensitive documents that describe the bribes taken are in an Adamantium safe that is about 3 feet on all sides. The combination to the safe can be found with a DC 17 investigation check. Otherwise, the safe can be broken out of the ground if someone succeeds on a DC 10 strength check.

Siege Questline:
The army is going to attack Lanbruk on the 11th of Florum. The 50 foot soldiers from the front attack the weakened section of the wall. The defenders focus the majority of their forces here. As the attackers reach the wall and fighting commences, the aerial forces attack from the cliffs, gliding in and ravaging the town.

Of the aerial attackers, they break up into 4 squads of 5 troops once they reach the town. The party has to fight 2 of the 4 groups. The first one is 1 goblin boss, 2 goblins, and 2 hobgoblins. The second squad has a hobgoblin captain instead of a goblin boss. If the party defeats the groups in a total of 6 rounds or less, they are able to stop them in time to prevent any significant damage. If the combats take more than 6 rounds, the party hears a commotion coming from the library. There are dead defenders around the entrance and the door has been forced in. As they enter, they see a mage (hobgoblin devastator) in a crimson cloak standing over a beaten up Chuck. Chuck reaches for a scroll on the ground but the mage smashes his arm with a quarterstaff and casts a crackling blast into his chest, killing him.

No matter how the mage dies, a note is found on his body that describes the Crimson Brand's mission of looking for something called the Void Seal, an artifact created by Ysaldan Vhal during the Arcane Resurgence.

Pylith Questline:

The ruins of Pylith are north of the Exalted Summit. The journey from Welbenwallow is about 100 miles, to the southwest.

Encounters on the way to Pylith:
A roadside gambler named Phil who offers to play Fiendish Fortune with the party.

A hidden stash of 1d4 level 1 spell scrolls. The stash is hidden under some leaves in the roots of a tree.

A green dragon wyrmling with a single cult fanatic that are trying to start a new cult. They accost the party asking for valuables or if they want to join.

Once at Pylith the party comes across a city in ruin. The city looks like at one point it consisted of around 150 buildings, all of which are now in ruin. With some investigation it becomes very apparent that the city was destroyed by dragons. Rows of houses have been destroyed in large swatches and stonework has large scratches across it.

On the far side of town, the ruins of a wizard tower poke above the rest of the decrepit buildings.

The front door of the tower still looks fairly intact. It has a small ornate door knocker on it and ivy growing up the door. A plaque above the door reads, "In this house we are *Courteous*". If any action is taken other than knocking, the door shocks the person for 1d6 lightning damage.

The first floor of the tower is still in good condition, and is kept in condition by animated brooms and dusters that work tirelessly keeping the room clean.

The second floor is an overgrown alchemy lab. There are many different workstations covered in vials filled with long dried solutions and some empty bowls with decayed herbs.

The third floor is completely overgrown and has 6 vine blights in it that attempt to attack the party.

The fourth floor is a laboratory that looks like it was once used to create constructs. The door to the top floor is locked with a combination lock. Next to the door, etched into the stone is a clue for the door. It reads: For all you constructs remember: the code contains 0, 3, 4, 5, 8. 4 is to the right of 5. 0 and 5 keep a maximum distance. The two digits on the right add up to the same number as the two digits on the left. Answer: 53480

On the fifth floor is Ysaldan's private study. It is guarded by a helmed horror.

Once defeated, the study can be searched. Inside a desk drawer is the other half of the map. With the map is a note that reads: "If you are reading this it means I am dead. I instructed one of my constructs to write this note should I die. I tore my map of the elderbark trees in half and entrusted the other half with someone who I trust very dearly. If you have found this note, it means you are dedicated to my cause and are worthy of knowledge. Follow the clues I have left in my notes to find my magnum opus."

About 30 miles south of Lanbruk is Welbenwallow. Welbenwallow is a small city / large town. About 30,000 people packed into a tight walled city that sits perched on top of a small hill. The walls of the city are segmented into plates of stone brick that are constantly shifting and protecting damaged plates. The walls also have devices on the top called Spellkillers which activate antimagic auras on the walls, preventing spells and teleportation. Inside the city are crowded streets loomed over by tall buildings. High above the streets, cable cars carry people among the rooftop society. On the streets, large walking automatons called Striders carry pedestrians to their destinations.

In Welbenwallow, the Hall of Records holds most of the city's knowledge and patents. The center of the city is a park called the Perpetual Plaza. The Hall of Records and the capitol building, The Consortium Spire, are both on the sides of the Perpetual Plaza. In the center of the Perpetual Plaza is a statue of a Rube Goldberg-like perpetual motion machine.

The guards of Welbenwallow use clockwork devices to assist them. They are known as the Bronzewardens, but many just call them the Brass. Many of them have Modrons that follow them around.

Political Situation in Welbenwallow:
Unable to operate in the Welbenwallow province legally, the mages of Spellhaven approached the Clockwork Consortium with a proposition. They offered to share advanced arcano-tech blueprints, exclusive magical research data, and harmonium crystal supplies with the city. The vote to accept the deal narrowly passed. The Spellhaven mages hired the Crimson Brand, a local mercenary company with established connections in the province to help them.

Many suspect that there were many shady deals and bribes that allowed the vote to pass. There is a small group of Consortium politicians that are very upset with the deal and are trying to find ways to revoke the Crimson Brand's exploratory license.

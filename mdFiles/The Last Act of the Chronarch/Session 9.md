Current Day: 20th of Florum, 2519 PS

Political Questline:
Esther knows 2 politicians that are the de facto leaders of the small faction of people against the Spellhaven mages. Their names are Lars Kline and Meriel Daes. The political faction they lead is known as the Wolves. There are about 10 politicians of the 150 on the Welbenwallow Council that support the Wolves. The Wolves' current goal is to find evidence that the Spellhaven mages bribed the Council members, and to show that evidence to the Free Congress, the governing body of No'Zaral. Most of the Council members likely keep records of their finances in their manors, especially the Council treasurer, Reubyn Elran.

Councilman Elran's manor is in the Skyward District, the top layer of the city where the cable cars transport people between fancy houses. Elran's Manor takes up an entire city block and has artificial trees and hedges that give the illusion of a grandiose courtyard in front of the house. He has private security that guard the manor around the clock. The only way to get to the manor are through the cable car checkpoints.

Inside the manor, the sensitive documents that describe the bribes taken are in an Adamantium safe that is about 3 feet on all sides. The combination to the safe can be found with a DC 17 investigation check. Otherwise, the safe can be broken out of the ground if someone succeeds on a DC 10 strength check.

Pylith Questline:
The ruins of Pylith are north of the Exalted Summit. The journey from Welbenwallow is about 100 miles, to the southwest.

Encounters on the way to Pylith:
A roadside gambler named Phil who offers to play Fiendish Fortune with the party.

A hidden stash of 1d4 level 1 spell scrolls and a level 2 spell scroll. The stash is hidden under some leaves in the roots of a tree.

A red dragon wyrmling with a single cult fanatic that are trying to start a new cult. They accost the party asking for valuables or if they want to join.

Once at Pylith the party comes across a city in ruin. The city looks like at one point it consisted of around 150 buildings, all of which are now in ruin. With some investigation it becomes very apparent that the city was destroyed by dragons. Rows of houses have been destroyed in large swatches and stonework has large scratches across it.

Near the city center is a stone mosaic in the ground. It's covered in moss and broken in some parts. Regardless, the picture can be understood for the most part. It depicts a group of heroes slaying a blue dragon. A DC 20 history check reveals that this is depicting the fall of Thalroth the Storm Wyrm and the end of the Age of Dragons.

On the far side of town, the ruins of a wizard tower poke above the rest of the decrepit buildings.

There is a single window on the tower at the very top, 120 feet in the air. If interacted with, it triggers a glyph of warding that casts a 1st level thunderwave, DC 17, that knocks the characters prone on a fail. The prone characters fall the 120 feet back to the ground.

The front door of the tower still looks fairly intact. It has a small ornate door knocker on it and ivy growing up the door. A plaque above the door reads, "In this house we are *Courteous*". If any action is taken other than knocking, the door shocks the person for 1d6 lightning damage.

The first floor of the tower is still in good condition, and is kept in condition by animated brooms and dusters that work tirelessly keeping the room clean.

The second floor is an overgrown alchemy lab. There are many different workstations covered in vials filled with long dried solutions and some empty bowls with decayed herbs. In the middle of the room is a large circular pressure plate, partially obscured by the overgrown vines. It can be spotted with a DC 15 perception check. The pressure plate triggers once three characters have stepped onto it, clicking down and puffing out black soot across the entirety of the room. A DC 16 Arcana check reveals that this is elemental residue and is highly flammable. More characters can further load the pressure plate, but as soon as one person leaves, releasing some of the weight, the opening in the middle sparks and ignites the soot in the room dealing everyone in the room 2d6 fire damage. For each turn spent in the room, a character takes another 1d6 fire damage.

The third floor is completely overgrown and has a shambling mound and 2 needle blights that attack the party.

The fourth floor is a laboratory that looks like it was once used to create constructs. The door to the top floor is locked with a combination lock. Next to the door, etched into the stone is a clue for the door. It reads: For all you constructs remember: the code contains 0, 3, 4, 5, 8. 4 is to the right of 5. 0 and 5 keep a maximum distance. The two digits on the right add up to the same number as the two digits on the left. Answer: 53480

On the fifth floor is Ysaldan's private study. It is guarded by 2 helmed horrors.

Once defeated, the study can be searched. At a desk against the wall near the window, a robed skeleton is slumped over it. An open book is grasped in one of the skeleton's hands. The book is an anthology of prayers to the goddess Harmonia.Â  Grasped in the skeletons other hand is an amulet with a singular large ruby inset in the middle. This amulet when activated within the study teleports the holder and any others within 5 feet to Ysaldan's demiplanar lair. In the desk drawers are collections of scribe's materials and spell components. On the other side of the room is a small shrine to Harmonia, with long burnt out candles, incense, and a tiny Harmonium crystal.

Inside the Demiplanar Lair:
The entrance room to the lair is a large open foyer made of finely carved and polished stone bricks. The ground underfoot is covered with plush red rugs with fine gold embroidery. There is a massive circular stained glass portrait on one side of the room and a viewing platform beneath it. The stained glass portrait depicts a disc with large figures looming over it on the left and the right. Standing on the disc are clearly humanoid figures engaged in combat. A DC 13 history or religion check reveals that this depicts the Great Dissension.

The rugs in this room lead towards an ornate doorway that has the elven word "Athera" written above it. The closest translation to common means "Crossroads". Through the door is a hallway that splits three ways. The hallways are tube shaped, made mostly of frosted glass that looks like it is spiderwebbed with cracks. To the left, the door is marked with the elven word meaning "To See". To the right, the door is marked with the elven word meaning "Power". Ahead, the door is marked with the elven word meaning "Song".

"To See":
This room acts as a scrying chamber. The edges of the room are obscured in magical darkness, but from what can be seen, it is at least 50 feet in every direction. Floating through the room are thousands of small crystal pieces. Accompanying these are threads of magical blue light that weave their way through the room. There is a path that cuts through this to a small plush circle in the center of the room. Occasionally, the reflections on the crystal shards align to show star constellations or magical runes. Any character with a sense of magic can detect the latent power in this room. A DC 20 arcana check lets them channel it enough to just catch a glimpse of a location they are thinking of. A natural 20 on the arcana check lets them cast the Scry spell for free.

"Power":
This room is for arcane innovation and invention. It also acts as a forge. The room itself is made up of many metal walkways that extend over a network of blue glowing pipes and a well of crackling energy beneath it all. Spread throughout the room are various pressure valves, and at the far end is a forge that channels the energy to create weapons. It looks as though a longsword was abandoned halfway through being completed in the crucible. There are 7 pressure valves, 3 already completed and 4 that are missing a pipe. The 4 pipes are scattered across the ground near the crucible. Each valve has an arithmetic expression, and each pipe has the solution to one of the expressions. After the 4 pipes are placed in the correct places, a DC 15 athletics check constructs the sword, creating a +1 longsword.

"Song":
This room acts as a teleportation hub. It has a high vaulted ceiling, and all sounds in the room echo beautifully around. The room is mostly empty, but some of the parts of the stone are oddly worn. A DC 10 investigation check finds small notes around the room that list frequencies and corresponding planes of existence. There is another door at the far end of this room that reads "Sanctuary". The door to the Sanctuary room is locked and has a circular cutout in the center. The key to this lock is a stone disc, with a half of the disc in the power room, and the other in the to see room.

"Sanctuary":
This room is Ysaldan's private quarters. The whole room is altered to look like a nice warm sunny day with flowering gardens and sweet gentle wind blowing. Along a winding stone path is a small gazebo with a desk, a bed, and a storage chest. A construct caretaker patrols the grounds keeping the wildlife kept, and is not aggressive towards the party. It understands common and elvish, but can't speak. Inside a desk drawer is the other half of the map. With the map is a note that reads: "If you are reading this it means I am dead. I instructed one of my constructs to write this note should I die. I tore my map of the elderbark trees in half and entrusted the other half with someone who I trust very dearly. If you have found this note, it means you are dedicated to my cause and are worthy of knowledge. Follow the clues I have left in my notes to find my magnum opus."

The chest has a bag of holding, a vial of Dust of Disappearance, 567 gp, and a 300 gp diamond in it. Once the caretaker assures that the party has the other map piece, it waves goodbye to the party and initiates the lair's self destruct sequence.

Return from Pylith:
On the journey back from Pylith, Rango realizes that his draconic contract mark has disappeared. On the way back where Roular was, they find him and Jeff slain. Roular's body looks like it was damaged by magic and physical weapons. The killing blow was from some slashing weapon that split his skull in half.

Roular was killed by an adventuring party that call themselves the Day/Night Drinkers (DND). They are a party of 4 that is slightly stronger than the party but not by much. They were on their way to the Exalted Summit to collect some Solarmoss but stumbled upon Roular and killed him.

Political Questline:
When returning to Welbenwallow, the party is informed that Lars Kline has recently died in an unfortunate accident. The official report is that he died from drunkenly falling and hitting his head on his desk in his house's study.

He died the day before the party arrived. The crime scene is currently closed off and guarded by city guards. The detective mages have activated a time-stop rune on the house to prevent any more decay on anything in the house.

What actually happened: Lars has a reputation for being a bit of an alcoholic. He always keeps a bottle of whiskey at his desk to drink from during his late nights pouring over legal documents. However, the Spellhaven mages poisoned his whiskey with wyvern toxin. This caused him to stand up and stumble around alarmed, before dying and falling, hitting his head on the corner of the desk, making it look like an accident.

Crime Scene:
Lars's death happened in the second floor study of his Skyward district townhouse. His body lies face down, sprawled out on the floor near the desk, a pool of dried blood surrounding the body. His head has a large gash on the temple where it smashed on the corner of the desk. A smashed drinking glass lays on the ground next to the body.

Clues:
The Whiskey Bottle: A Bearclaw brand bottle of 100 proof whiskey. The whiskey bottle only has about an eighth of the content left. A DC 20 investigation or perception check notices that the whiskey smells a little off. A check with alchemist's or brewers supplies makes the DC 13.

The Body: The body lies face down in the pool of dried blood. A DC 20 medicine check reveals a closing of the wind pipe that indicates poisoning.

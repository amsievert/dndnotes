Jib is 612 years old. He was born on 2 Planimor, 1906 PS, in Wizendell. He was born to two Gnomish parents named Jomble and Fib Wemblebamp. Jomble and Fib were small shop owners. They ran a bookstore in Lower Wizendell. Jib spent years reading every book on the shelves. To continue to sate his hunger for reading, his parents enrolled him in the Divinaire Institute in Wizendell. He studied there until he was about 30. During his time, he became a certified scrier,Â  and spent some time as a professor. However, he wasn't happy with how the Institute was being run, so he left the Institute and worked for the Clockwork Consortium for a while. He worked from Wizendell as well as Bippenbol. He worked this job for around 150 years until he was offered a new position at the Divinaire Institute as Head Ambassador to Valdens. He decided to move back because this was a serious upgrade, and there was a new headmaster that he liked more than the old one. Jib spent lots of time teleporting around, spending time in Spellhaven, Divi, and Wizendell. He did this job for 300 years, until he was around 500, when he had enough of the bureaucracy of Valdens, and wanted to step down and work somewhere more chill. He stayed within the Institute, but became the Head of Security at the Divinaire Campus in Holfirth. He worked here until he met the party and quit.

The siege most likely ends. If Kardag is killed, the armor can be stripped off his body and reclaimed. Jiri takes the party to see Dara Erneth the head overseer of the province. She directs them to see Lord Pixton for their reward. Lord Pixton gives the party 500 platinum coins from his own personal stash. He also gives them a bag of holding and a philter of love. He also grants them a nice house near the artisan district. If the party wants to investigate the missing wages, Dara Erneth tells them that her boss is Supreme Overseer Helga Lawbringer. She also knows that the treasurer of the Federation is Gerald Shaffer. Besides that, all she knows is that the wages suddenly stopped with no explanation from the higher-ups.

Galvenport Larold Quest:

Overview: Larold the Merchant travelled to Galvenport to deliver his shipment of Zephyr Armor. He was supposed to drop his shipment off at the Divinaire Academy Campus, but never made it there. His shipment was stopped by the Constabulary, and they sent for Head Archivist Mathias Ilacrous to inspect the magic items. He determined that they needed to be further tested at the Grand Archives. Before the shipment made it to the archives, it was again stolen, and Larold disappeared. The official account is that Larold ran off with the goods, but in reality, Ilacrous hired some goons to stage a theft so that Ilacrous could turn the goods into Ileus's Simulacrum, Cavius.

The main enemy of this part of the campaign is Ileus's Simulacrum or Simulacrums I don't know if there's gonna be multiple or not yet.

Important People: Larold was supposed to meet with Bingle McMahon, the shipping manager at the Divinaire Campus.

Ileus's Simulacrum uses disguise self and goes by the name Cavius.

Larold's emerald earing is actually a sending stone with the other side connected to

The main part of the bar is a viewing/lounge area surrounding a gravel pit in the middle, where fights happen and bets are placed. The fights are to submission and not to death. Despite this, there are nearly no rules in the fights, the no killing is more enforced by the actual fighters.
The champion fighter of the pit is a Githzerai Monk (Githzerai Zerth) named K'lish Targoth.

The Jewel Casino:
Games to play: 3 die divination, Fiendish Fortune, and regular Blackjack.
The Casino is owned by someone known as the Patrician. No one knows who he really is, but no one dares to cross him because anyone who does is never heard from again.
In the actual Casino, illusory spells make the walls and ceilings seem mystical and fill the air with mystical lights and flashes and sounds. Some of the dealers and bartenders cast suggestion or command or friends on the players to convince them to drink more or gamble more.
There is an underground club under the Casino named The Tomb, where people go fucking hard. People do hard drugs here, the music is bussin, and it is invite only and super exclusive. The main event at this club for the week is Bug Man Jones, a thri kreen who uses all of his hands to use like 6 different turntables.
There are various drinks to be bought in the casino, one of which enhances a players luck and essentially grants them one luck point to use during gambling, which can be used to reroll a die or get a new card in a card game
Another drink gives the consumer expertise on charisma checks for 10 minutes.
The bartenders also sell a drink that casts the modify memory on the drinker so that they can forget their losses of the night.

Galvenport Larold Quest:

Overview: Larold the Merchant travelled to Galvenport to deliver his shipment of Zephyr Armor. He was supposed to drop his shipment off at the Divinaire Academy Campus, but never made it there. His shipment was stopped by the Constabulary, and they sent for Head Archivist Mathias Ilacrous to inspect the magic items. He determined that they needed to be further tested at the Grand Archives. Before the shipment made it to the archives, it was again stolen, and Larold disappeared. The official account is that Larold ran off with the goods, but in reality, Ilacrous hired some goons to stage a theft so that Ilacrous could turn the goods into Ileus's Simulacrum, Cavius.
The main enemy of this part of the campaign is Ileus's Simulacrum or Simulacrums I don't know if there's gonna be multiple or not yet.

Important People: Larold was supposed to meet with Bingle McMahon, the shipping manager at the Divinaire Campus.
Ileus's Simulacrum uses disguise self and goes by the name Cavius.
Larold's emerald earing is actually a sending stone with the other side connected to

Exploration Notes
Temple of Mortessa:
Head Priestess: Raven Queen Nantoth
Preacher: Soul Speaker Planestrider
Description: The temple is made of black stone bricks and is built in a heavy gothic style. In the middle of the congregation hall, there is a large golden scale. All over the cathedral are gargoyles that are shaped like ravens.

The Arm Bar:
Bartender/Owner: Slum Glumby (Large Tortle who speaks and moves very slowly)
The main part of the bar is a viewing/lounge area surrounding a gravel pit in the middle, where fights happen and bets are placed. The fights are to submission and not to death. Despite this, there are nearly no rules in the fights, the no killing is more enforced by the actual fighters.
The champion fighter of the pit is a Githzerai Monk (Githzerai Zerth) named K'lish Targoth.

The Jewel Casino:

Games to play: 3 die divination, Fiendish Fortune, and regular Blackjack.
The Casino is owned by someone known as the Patrician. No one knows who he really is, but no one dares to cross him because anyone who does is never heard from again.
In the actual Casino, illusory spells make the walls and ceilings seem mystical and fill the air with mystical lights and flashes and sounds. Some of the dealers and bartenders cast suggestion or command or friends on the players to convince them to drink more or gamble more.
There is an underground club under the Casino named The Tomb, where people go fucking hard. People do hard drugs here, the music is bussin, and it is invite only and super exclusive. The main event at this club for the week is Bug Man Jones, a thri kreen who uses all of his hands to use like 6 different turntables.
There are various drinks to be bought in the casino, one of which enhances a players luck and essentially grants them one luck point to use during gambling, which can be used to reroll a die or get a new card in a card game
Another drink gives the consumer expertise on charisma checks for 10 minutes.
The bartenders also sell a drink that casts the modify memory on the drinker so that they can forget their losses of the night.

Constabulary Building:
Located inside the inner locks and backed up against the inner wall. The building is a large brick building built out of the same stone as the city walls. Inside 2 large double doors is a small waiting room with an aarokocra woman sitting behind a desk. Behind the desk is an open doorway that leads to the rest of the building (which is pretty much modeled after a police station). On the upper floor of the station is the detective offices, this is where Detective Thessa works. He's a satyr who was responsible for investigating the Larold case. In the basement of the office is the archives, where Larold's file is.

The file describes how Mathias Ilacrous told the Constabulary to keep a look out for a merchant carrying a shipment of magical armor. Once Detective Thessa and the Constabulary stopped Larold and sent for Ilacrous. The file details how the shipment was sent to the Grand Archives, but was robbed on the way there, and the shipment was stolen. Then on this page there is a note from the head Constable that says to report officially that Larold ran off with it to save face with Ilacrous.

When approached, the aarokocra woman asks if they have a crime to report or if they're here to bail someone out. The party is for sure not able to access the rest of the station without a very good reason. In the lobby there is also a security guard.

Treasury:
The treasury runs very similarly to a bank. The treasury building is a 4 story building located in the block of houses between the west Inner Locks gate and the port. The upper two stories have large bay windows all around. There's a line of tellers at the in the main lobby of the first floor, which is taller than the other floors. The other 3 floors are all offices for the bank workers and for the Federation Treasury people. On the first floor there is also a large 10 foot diameter vault that leads underground. The vault is heavily guarded.

On the 4th floor is a fancy office with a large window overlooking the port. This office belongs to Councilman Gerald Shaffer. He is also the Treasurer of the Larenthian Federation. Everything in his office is normal and not incriminating. There are lots of letters from Supreme Overseer Helga Lawbringer, talking about organizing the collection of taxes from the cities of the Alliance. There are lots of tax documents about the office.

Upon a DC 18 investigation check, a character can find a hidden compartment that contains documents from Cavius, the Simulacrum. There are letters threatening Shaffer's family and his position on the Chief's Council and telling him to withhold the funds from Holfirth until the siege is complete.

Faerie's Wing Epidemic:
Starting while the party is investigating the Larold case and the money case, a Wing epidemic is brewing. Wing is a new drug just hitting the market, and people aren't used to its effect yet. There is a mysterious phenomenon starting of people walking off of roofs and dying with no explanation. No one knows why it is happening.

The drug begins circulating in the Underguild, and eventually starts hitting the Tomb as well. However, most of the drug use in the Tomb is still Dragon Dust and Medusa's Glare.

Someone that the party knows is going to die from Wing but I don't know who yet.

Drugs:
- Efreeti Essence:
	- Sold in small glass jars. Inside the jar is a magical swirling essence. To take, the user opens the jar and inhales the essence. This drug gives the user advantage on perception checks and 8 temp hp, but prolonged use can induce madness. Withdrawal symptoms also include irritability, exhaustion, and madness as well.

- Medusa's Glare:
	- Sold in small capsules, two capsules equate to one dose. The drug is taken by squeezing the capsules out into one's eyes. The drug paralyzes the consumer but gives them vivid daydreams and hallucinations. The daydreams and hallucinations are extremely pleasant and calming, or even nostalgic. This drug is very addictive, and constant abuse will turn the user into stone. Withdrawal symptoms include extreme mood swings and depression. Everything starts to look less colorful and vivid. The sufferer also has a harder time concentrating on tasks (including spells).

- Dragon Dust:
	- Essentially molly/ecstasy. It is a dust that is sold in a small box and then snorted from the box. The user enters a euphoric and lustful state. They act similar to if they've taken a philter of love, but with everyone. Everything seems more vibrant and the user becomes flooded with intense happiness and emotion. The user gains advantage on charisma checks for 4 hours, but then has disadvantage on charisma checks for the next day.

- Faerie's Wing:
	- This drug is a small dried out tab that is placed on the tongue. When taken, it makes the user feel happy, carefree, joyful, and light as air. It gives the user the effect of the Featherfall spell for 30 minutes. However, the user feels as if they have feather fall for around 2 hours.

Armored Wagon Heist:
On the 20th of Aestia around midday, the Armored Wagon returns from Holfirth. The convoy consists of 3 covered wagons. The canvas covering the wagons displays the sigil of the Treasury Office. The safe containing the coins is in one of the wagons, but it changes up based on the trip so it's harder to rob. Each wagon has 4 guards on it, 2 driving and 2 sitting in the back. There are also 4 additional guards on horses that accompany the caravan. Each guard is wearing half plate armor with a shield (18 AC) and has a spear and longsword. The caravan heads in through the town gates without issue and then heads straight to the Treasury. All of the guards and wagons enter through the back garage door and then head inside from there.

After about an hour, all of the guards leave the Treasury. The guard who was driving the money wagon is named Philo Teeta. He is a male half-elf with short cropped blond hair and slight stubble. He has a medium build and is very loved by everyone because he's very charismatic and funny.

He lives in the middle-class houses to the north of the Inner Locks. His house is a very standard suburban house. He has a wife that lives with him and owns a home business selling flowers.

If pressured enough, he will reveal that he was one of the drivers that made the delivery to Holfirth right after the siege. Shaffer told them to wait to deliver the money until he told them to leave. Shaffer didn't give a reason, just "because I said so". Philo has access to the back door of the Treasury and clearance to get to the second floor of the building. Through further persuading he will help the party break in. He tells the party that no one is in the building at night and that there are security measures inside the building, so if they were able to get through the guards they could get in. Or during the day, they could try to bluff their way in with his clearance to the second floor.

Information from interrogation of Philo:

- Made delivery to Holfirth right after the Siege
- The drivers were set to deliver the normal payment for Soltide, but Councilman Gerald Shaffer, the boss, told them to wait to leave until he said so
- Shaffer didn't give a reason for waiting. "Because he said so"
- Philo has access to the back door of the Treasury
- Philo also has clearance to access the second floor.
- Between the first and second floor in the back of the Treasury is another security checkpoint
- The driver's lounge is on the second floor

Further/more intense interrogation

- There is almost no one inside the treasury at night, but there are more guards outside and they are more vigilant
- No one is allowed to go in through any of the doors at night however
- During the day there are less guards outside and they are more lax, but there are people working in the treasury

Information regarding Cavius II:

"Cavius II" is what I'm calling Ileus's simulacrum that is terrorizing Galvenport. The mechanics behind the simulacrum work slightly different than an actual simulacrum. This modified simulacrum has been modified by Ileus since he is an Ancient Archmage and literally played a part in creating the Illusion school of magic. Ileus gave the simulacrum the name "Cavius" after his apprentice from long ago. Ileus is not aware that the real Cavius's soul lives on in the Ring of Mind Shielding. Cavius II is slightly different from a normal simulacrum in the sense that he regenerates spell slots like a normal character, and can heal himself using the gold to hit point exchange of a normal simulacrum. If killed, he will turn to snow and ash just like a normal simulacrum. Ileus imbued Cavius II with an exact replica of his mind, so Cavius II and Ileus share the exact same personality. Because of this mental link, Ileus is able to remotely take control of Cavius II if he chooses.

Cavius II, acting mostly of his own accord, has infiltrated deep into the Larenthian Government. Through deception, blackmail, and manipulation, he has gotten into a spot where he is trusted by some people in the government, and under the table he is also blackmailing people into doing his dirty work. Chief Alfir trusts him a lot, as does Dormar Talovol, the head diviner of the alliance and the headmaster of the Divinaire Institute.

Cavius II has been infiltrating the Larenthian government for around a year now, and people in the government know about him, but he isn't on any official government records. He doesn't hold an official position of power, and some people think he is just a rumor. He is very much real though, and is arguably more influential than the Chief, at least in Galvenport politics.

He lives in a secret room in the grand study of the Platinum Palace, given to him by Chief Alfir. Alfir himself is very secretive about his relationship with Cavius II.

Places where Cavius II's influence can be found:

- Investigating Mathias Ilacrous at the grand archives would reveal that he has notes Cavius II promising to get him ancient tomes and knowledge in exchange for Larold's Zephyr Armor shipment. Mathias Ilacrous is happily working with Cavius II because he is a seeker of knowledge above all, and isn't scared to do bad things to get it.
- Investigating Gerald Shaffer at the Federation Treasury will turn up documents in a hidden drawer of Shaffer's desk in his office that are blackmail notes from Cavius II, threatening his family and his position on the Mercantable. Cavius II told Shaffer to withhold the guard payments from Holfirth until after the siege, which Shaffer did reluctantly.
- Investigating Larold's file will show that Larold's shipment was robbed on its way to the Grand Archives. It details the location of the robbery, a side street in the neighborhood around the Divinaire Campus and the Grand Archives. It also says that the official report is that Larold ran off with the shipment, in order to save face with Ilacrous, because the Constabulary were supposed to guard the shipment on its way.

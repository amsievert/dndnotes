Day: 14th of Calo, 2519 PS

As the party long rests, Chouch receives a dream from Cavius II. In it, Cavius II/Ileus thanks Chouch for delivering the Armor of Valos to him. He says that this will greatly help in his cause. He warns Chouch to stay away from other Relics of Dissension. The dream takes place in Ileus's very lavish study back in his lair on another plane.

Ileus's next part of his master plan is to seize more control in the Larenthian Government, and persuade them to go to begin an invasion of Rodigia. He is doing this because he wants to collect the Hammer of Epius.

Bippenbol: Bippenbol has large 40 foot high walls that surround a tiered city. Along the battlements of the walls are swiveling gunpowder cannons and large arcane cannons. If the party wishes to enter the city, they must pay the traveller's tax. This tax is a piece of knowledge or information deemed worthy enough by a Learned One. A popular tavern is the Exploding Barrel, run by an erratic gnome.

Bippenbol Plains encounter: The party comes across five hunters sitting around a fire on the side of the road near night time. The hunters are Lyle, George, Gunther, Thomas, and Henry (Hal). They are all humans or elves. They are very friendly and love meeting new people. They are hunting for a Roc that is rumored to be living in the nearby forest and hunting across the plains.

Another encounter: As the party passes close to Traskip Bay, they witness a naval battle between two large ships taking place.

Shadowwood Forest Encounters:

- The party comes across a stone giant sleeping very soundly. There are decently sized trees growing on top of him in a bunch of dirt.
- The party finds a small altar to Terra. The altar sits in a small igloo-like structure made from roots and vines woven together. On the altar is a small crystal, a small earthenware jug of potent alcohol, and a bowl of burnt herbs and incense. The herbs are still smoking. Recently burnt.
- A wood elf sits at a stump across from a weasel. On the face of the stump is a chess board carved out. They are playing chess. The elf and weasel are both friendly, but the weasel gets mad if people question his intelligence. The elf offers to play someone in a game after this one. The game is called Checks (it's just chess).
- The party comes across a crime scene where a caravan was attacked. Upon investigation, it appears that a cart may have escaped. The cart has escaped to a small cave on the side of a hill in the hills by Serpent's Pass

Serpent's Pass: In serpent's pass, about halfway down, a huge, 300 foot long purple worm skeleton can be found. The path goes straight through its ribcage.

After the serpent skeleton, the party is attacked by the bandit's that attacked the other caravan. A bunch of halfling bandits attack from the hills.

At the branded pass, there is a Larenthian border checkpoint. They bid the party safe travels and tell them to stop at the Qazide Trading Post if they need supplies.

If anyone is out in the sun and does not have a headwrap on, they must make a DC 10 constitution saving throw at the beginning of each day. On a fail, they take a point of exhaustion.

A few hours outside of the trading post, the party finds an oasis about 20 feet on each side. There are some trees and a small pond. Buried at the bottom of the pond is a 10 foot tall metal breastplate with a symbol that looks like a circle with three lines coming off the top. This is the symbol of Libai.

Qazide Trading Post (Kah-see-day): This trading post sits along the northern-most border of the eternal scorch at the entrance to the area via the branded pass. Serves as a refill station for any last-minute necessities before taking the perilous journey into the Scorch. Can provide a guide (if needed) or even guards to help escort your caravan across the scorch.

The owner of the trading post is a goblin named Riz. He tells the party that they must buy head wraps or else they will overheat in the desert. He sells headwraps for 60 gp. A monstrous price. He also advises the party to travel by night and beware of bandits.

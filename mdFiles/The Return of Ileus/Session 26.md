Day: 6th of Ignus, 2519 PS

Kha'anj
Population: 10,256 (89% Goblinoids, 5% Humans, 5% Tieflings, 1% Other)

Government: An oligarchy known as the Sayid Alma runs the oasis. There are 4 Sayids that make up the Sayid Alma. They enforce their strict policies via the Ma'himat, the city guards. The Sayid Alma mostly deals with issues of trade and punishment. The capitol building of Kha'anj is called the Castle of Brass. It is in the middle of the oasis, overlooking the main body of water, the Water of Life (Ma' Alhaya).

Lore: The Oasis was formed during the Battle of the Planes, when Libai had her hand chopped off. It fell to the ground and from it, the Oasis blossomed. The Water of Life in the middle is said to be the blood that pooled from the lost hand. The Sayid Alma took over the Oasis around 2450 PS, roughly 75 years ago. Before them, the Oasis was a much smaller settlement, called the Wahatan Oasis. It served as a safe stop for travellers and had no real government. Permanent settlement began with the Wahatan Era only around 2300 PS.

While in the city, the party is approached by a mean-looking female goblin named Maggie. She calls Saraq "Saghir" and warns him that the Tilktan are looking for him and that they want blood. She tells him that if the tribe didn't catch him coming in, they must have moved south.

Maggie doesn't know the rest of the story which is: The Tak family (The other fighting family from the Tilktan Tribe) has essentially taken over the tribe. Since Saraq and his brother were his mother's only children, they were the only heirs to her position. The leader of the Tak family, Clargg, offered up one of his sons, Nabim, to be the next heir. Saraq's mother, Akima, was opposed to this and made it known that she would never let this happen. A few years after Saraq's banishment, his mother mysteriously disappeared while traveling one day, and Nabim took her spot, with Clargg intimidating anyone who tried to say otherwise. Saraq was presumed to be dead after his banishment, but since he was spotted returning to the desert, the Tilktan, led by Clargg and Nabim, have been trying to hunt him down and kill him to secure their rule.

As the party leaves the Oasis and heads to Falstor, they might notice that there are groups of 2 following the party. After a day or two, the party is set upon by a group of bandits sledding down one of the dunes. There are 10 bandits in total (1 Mage, 1 Master Thief, 4 Archers, and 4 Veterans). The Mage has the following spells prepared: Fire Bolt, Message, Minor Illusion, Light; Mage Armor, Shield, Sleep, Chromatic Orb; Hold Person, Suggestion; Sending, Fireball, Dispel Magic. The Master Thief is Nabim Tak, the heir to Akima's seat in the tribe leaders, and the son of Clargg Tak. His mission is to capture Saraq and bring him back to the Tilktan tribe so that he can face punishment for killing his brother during their coming of age mission.

This is not at all what actually happened, but after Saraq's banishment, Clargg began spreading the rumor that Saraq had killed his brother, Easifa, during the coming of age ritual and that the banishment was unrighteous and he should be killed instead. Nabim informs the rest of the party that they are welcome to leave but if they try to intervene they will also be captured and killed.

Clargg has the Champion stat block, but uses a one-handed longsword instead of a spear, and has +1 studded leather armor. If he is attacked outright, whoever remains from the ambush party joins the fight, or if they are all dead, 2 archers and 2 veterans join the fight.

Kha'anj Quests:
The party comes across someone from the Skrekin Traditionalists. She explains to them what the group is about and asks them to help with a quest. There was a group exploring a Sandsail ruin out to the west. They lost contact a few days ago and need someone to go check it out.

Everyone in the camp is either missing or dead and a horde of mummies and zombies has taken their place. Through investigation, the party can find a manual with drawings descibing how to craft a Sandsail and another journal scrap that looks really old. It describes how to cast a spell that creates water. Mechanically it is just a scroll of create food and water.

The Water of Life glows a faint emerald green at night. Some say that it is because the water has ancient healing properties. Others think it was contaminated by the Skrekin people. Yet others think that there is a portal to another plane at the bottom. This is actually true. There is a plane at the bottom of the Water that leads to The Beastlands. This portal was created by the Skrekin scholars in an experiment in extraplanar travel.

Â If the party gets along with the Skrekin Traditionalists, they can take up another mission. Jerg Jag is secretly a Traditionalist and needs help faking his death. They ask the party to help come up with the scenario.

The Ruined Sandsail:
The party is given the quest to check in on the Sandsail camp. Once they find the camp, it is pretty obvious that there is a decent-sized crater in the middle of the camp. Around the crater is camp debris as well as some charred, dismembered bodies. Around the rest of the camp, there are more bodies. However, a DC 13 medicine check reveals that these bodies died from bludgeoning force not from the meteor. When someone approaches the meteor, a star spawn Hulk emerges from it. After defeating the Hulk, the party is free to search the camp. They will uncover in one of the tents a clay tablet that has the following inscribed on it:

Amidst the sands, where whispers die,
A secret sleeps beneath the sky.
A heart unknown, where waters weep,
A pathway lies, in slumber deep.
Glowing faint, with emerald hue,
A portal waits for one so true.
To tread its path, one must be bold,
And seek the land where beasts unfold.

A DC 17 Investigation check reveals an intact chest in another tent that has a pouch of 30 gold coins, a larger Skrekin coin, The Labors of Pylaxes, and a cool safari hat.

A DC 22 Investigation check reveals a charred journal page describing the Skrekin artifact they are looking for. The artifact is a "Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals". The Skrekin Traditionalists believe that when used with the Water of Life, it will conjure an extra powerful elemental imbued with the power of Libai.

Recruitment
When the party returns from the Sandsail ruin, the next quest is to spread propaganda about the revolution. They are given some flyers to hang up and also told to talk to people, especially the middle class people. They have to be careful though because if the Ma'himat hear any mention of revolution, they will intervene.

The Downfall of Sayid Jag
After a few days of recruitment, the party is called back to the ruins of the Library of Skrei. The Leader of the Revolution, Aldo, explains that Sayid Jag has liked the progress of the revolution and is ready to take a heavier role. However, he can't just up and join, but needs to be free. He would like help faking his death.

The Portal
The leader of the revolution admits that they still have no idea what the riddle means. They need the party to figure it out and follow it. The portal to the beastlands at the bottom of the Water of Life leads to a forest clearing with a cobbled ground. There are 5 centaurs guarding the bowl of water elemental conjuring.

The Attack
Once the bowl is in possession of the Traditionalists, they are ready to attack. The Revolution Leader takes the bowl to the temple of Libai and summons the elemental. It is way bigger than normal because of the magical properties of the water, and the Leader starts leading it on a rampage, first destroying the Sayid Estates, and then moving on to the rich districts. The Elemental is a gargantuan creature, reaching nearly 100 feet tall. It has the stats of a water elemental but with way more health and dealing 4d8 damage on a slam instead.

The party is tasked with killing Odrokos Maul. He is rumored to be holed up at the Castle of Brass. Once he is defeated, the party must raise the flag of the revolution from the top of the palace.

Sayid Odrokos Maul (Hobgoblin Warlord) waits in the throne room along with his wife/advisor, who is actually a succubus, and his son (Hobgoblin Captain).

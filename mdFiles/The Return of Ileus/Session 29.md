Day: 27th of Ignus, 2519 PS

Rodigia Encounters:
After travelling through Rodigia for about a day, the party sees a giant elk standing on the path. Suddenly a large arrow flies from the brush and strikes the elk, killing it instantly. A stone giant walks out from the brush and begins field dressing the elk. Open for RP here. Eventually, a Rodigian Ranger approaches and begins scolding the giant hunter. Elk are endangered in this area, but the giant needs food because he's so big.

As the party reaches the top of a snowy summit, they pass by a small cavern opening. They hear a banging noise coming from inside. Inside, the cave is covered in glowing crystals of all colors. A frost giant with a pickaxe is breaking crystals off and collecting them in a large sack. He is skeptical of the party, and acts shifty, not explaining what the crystals are. In actuality, the crystals can be refined into pure Harmonium. Harmonium is the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. This can be a roleplay or combat encounter.

As the party traverses a valley, a Roc swoops down from the summits above, attacking the party. Once it becomes bloody, it retreats, and with a DC18 perception check, someone can spot a small rock outcropping where the Roc perches. On top of this outcropping, the Roc has a nest. Inside it is a large Roc egg, and a treasure hoard.

Dalonstor:
If the party doesn't head to the Alystri Manor soon after arriving in Dalonstor, they will start to notice mysterious figures spying on them from the shadows. These are spies of House Alystri. Eventually, Kila Alystri approaches them and urges them to come to the Alystri manor.

At the manor, Aaryn greets them and is happy to see Astarius. Balor however is not very happy that Astarius is back. He believes that Astarius's return brings shame onto the family because of how he disappeared. Aaryn invites Astarius to the next Alystri council meeting.

At the council meeting, the house leaders are discussing how to respond to the recent transgressions of House Rocc. In the past week, the Nightstalkers have started abducting people off the streets after curfew, Meridan Rocc has been only getting stronger in the Arena, and Reev Rocc is getting more support because of these people.

Aaryn advocates for Astarius to take on Meridan in the arena to swing public favor for the Alystris. Balor doesn't like this idea, as he doesn't believe Astarius would win and even if he did win, the public wouldn't be convinced by that victory. Percival thinks that the Alystris should give up and pledge fealty to the Roccs. And Stefan thinks that the Alystris should just kill all of the Roccs in power.

The Meridan Rocc Conspiracy:
Meridan Rocc has the gladiator stat block. However, along with the help of Sable and the Night Stalkers, he has been sacrificing people beneath the Rocc mansion and siphoning their life force to strengthen himself. While under the effect of the extra life force, he is resistant to all damage, and heals 10 hp per round. This is the cause of the increased abductions by the Night Stalkers.

Plate Armor: If Astarius makes his father proud, he will gift him his plate armor from when he was a fighter. This could happen maybe if Astarius fights the buffed Meridan Rocc and somehow survives.

Day: 8th of Otun, 2519 PS

Aaryn's Funeral will take place on the 5th of Otun. All of the Alystris attend the funeral as well as the servants and retinue soldiers.

As a result of the dispel magic in the fight, the Nightstalker abductions increase to rebuff Meridan to have the shadow healing. If no rituals are performed for 3 days, Meridan loses both the healing and the thick skin.

The Army
The army of 45,000 marching through the desert will eventually reach Rodigia. From there they besiege Rhugnurt. While being a distraction for Ileus, all of the soldiers and commanders still believe that this is a real siege. Their goal is to sack the city in a show of power to intimidate the Mountain King into entering into a pact alliance with Larenthia, and to turn over all of Rodigia's key exports to Larenthian merchants to prevent another "attack".

Meanwhile, Ileus travels to Mount Smedr to retrieve the Hammer of Epius by himself.

The Meridan Rocc Conspiracy:
Meridan Rocc has the Gladiator stat block. However, along with the help of the hidden Rocc child Jess Rocc and the Night Stalkers, they have been sacrificing people to Artanor beneath the Rocc mansion and siphoning their life force to strengthen Meridan. They must do this every few days to keep the buff active. While buffed in this way, Meridan is resistant to all damage and heals 10hp per round. This conspiracy is the reason for the ongoing abductions by the Night Stalkers.

The Laboratory:
Hidden beneath the Rocc Manor, Jess Rocc's laboratory toils away. It is accessed by pulling a book labelled The Rituals of Artanor. A secret staircase opens up and leads down to the Lab. Jess Rocc works down there day and night, researching rituals to make Meridan stronger. There are a few people down in the Lab in cages, awaiting sacrifice. Jess Rocc has the [Cult Leader](https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/cult-leader-3pp/) stat block, and he has 4 cult fanatics that work with him.

Troubled Waters:
Since Reev Rocc got in power, the Rocc's fishing waters have slowly been expanding, taking over the waters of the other houses. Houses Mason and Pili are sequestered to tiny parts of Dalonstor's waters. House Alystri still has reasonable waters, but House Rocc is slowly claiming more and more. This normally wouldn't be allowed, but since Siobhan Rocc runs the Fishing Guild, she controls all documents of official fishing lands, and these conveniently change for House Rocc. Alystri fishing ships near the borders are being attacked and sunk by Rocc warships. The Alystris have lost 2 of their warships to the superior Rocc warships.

The Shipping Guild:
Robert Rocc of the Shipping Guild controls both the building of ships and the flow of goods in and out of Dalonstor. Robert Rocc is the least corrupt of the Steward's council. He allows trade to proceed naturally and doesn't interfere with it at all. He does however use the Shipping Guild's research team to develop new and stronger warships and keep the innovations within Rocc hands. This is why the Rocc warships are so superior to the other Houses'.

Resources:
The Alystris have 3 warships (1 with 4 cannons instead of 2 mangonels) and 10 Keelboats (Fishing boats). The Roccs have 8 warships (4 with 4 cannons instead of 2 mangonels) and 30 Keelboats. All of the Rocc warships have the Defiant Sails upgrade (All ranged attacks against the ships and crew are at disadvantage).

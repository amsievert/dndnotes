Day: 19th of Otun, 2519 PS

The Army
The army of 45,000 marching through the desert will eventually reach Rodigia. From there they besiege Rhugnurt. While being a distraction for Ileus, all of the soldiers and commanders still believe that this is a real siege. Their goal is to sack the city in a show of power to intimidate the Mountain King into entering into a pact alliance with Larenthia, and to turn over all of Rodigia's key exports to Larenthian merchants to prevent another "attack".

Meanwhile, Ileus travels to Mount Smedr to retrieve the Hammer of Epius by himself.

Steward's Council Members:
Mayor: Reev Rocc (Warlord)
Arena Champion: Meridan Rocc (Gladiator)
Watch Captain: Sable Rocc (Blackguard)
Fishing Guild: Siobhan Rocc (Mage)
Ship Guild: Robert Rocc (Transmutation Wizard)

Knoglir, the All-Knowing:
Deep beneath a mountain near Mount Smedr, an ancient emerald dragon named Knoglir, the All-Knowing. He hoards knowledge rather than treasure. He has been alive since before the Dissension, staying alive by mostly hiding beneath an Illusion in his mountain lair. However, he was friends with Epius the Archmage of Transmutation. Epius worked in the forge of Mount Smedr for a bit, and Knoglir became friends with him during that time. Knoglir learned a lot from Epius, keeping it all safe in his perfect memory. After the scourge, Knoglir made a deal with Uvira to keep an eye on Epius's forge. In his free time, Knoglir also began collecting knowledge on everything about the Dissension that he had not learned from Epius, this included information on the locations of the Relics of Dissension.

In the modern day, he knows the locations of all of the Relics or at least where the plot hook for each one is. He can be reasoned with by the party to get some of his knowledge.

Troubled Waters:
Since Reev Rocc got in power, the Rocc's fishing waters have slowly been expanding, taking over the waters of the other houses. Houses Mason and Pili are sequestered to tiny parts of Dalonstor's waters. House Alystri still has reasonable waters, but House Rocc is slowly claiming more and more. This normally wouldn't be allowed, but since Siobhan Rocc runs the Fishing Guild, she controls all documents of official fishing lands, and these conveniently change for House Rocc. Alystri fishing ships near the borders are being attacked and sunk by Rocc warships. The Alystris have lost 2 of their warships to the superior Rocc warships.

The Shipping Guild:
Robert Rocc of the Shipping Guild controls both the building of ships and the flow of goods in and out of Dalonstor. Robert Rocc is the least corrupt of the Steward's council. He allows trade to proceed naturally and doesn't interfere with it at all. He does however use the Shipping Guild's research team to develop new and stronger warships and keep the innovations within Rocc hands. This is why the Rocc warships are so superior to the other Houses'.

UPDATED Resources:
The Alystris have 4 warships (1 with 4 cannons instead of 2 mangonels and 1 captured Rocc Mangonel Warship at 1 HP) and 10 Keelboats (Fishing boats). The Roccs have 7 warships (4 with 4 cannons instead of 2 mangonels) and 30 Keelboats. All of the Rocc cannon warships have the Defiant Sails upgrade (All ranged attacks against the ships and crew are at disadvantage).

The March on Alystri Manor:
During the celebrations of Astarius's win in the arena, Reev and Sable Rocc show up at the gates of Alystri manor with a bunch of night stalkers. Reev calls for Sylas and Balor to meet him at the wall. Reev asks them if they would like to sue for peace. If they say no, Sable has some men wheel out a mangonel. Reev reminds the Alystris that they did this. The mangonel fires and the large rock lands in the Alystri cemetery, destroying two of the statues in there. After the first shot fires, Reev tells the Alystris that Rocc Manor is open for peace negotiations. He waits outside while the firing continues. They shoot until all of the statues are destroyed. After this, they load in incendiary rounds and begin firing on all of the surrounding buildings of the manor within the walls. If nothing happens still, then they leave.

Peace Negotiations:
The Peace Negotiations take place at Rocc Manor in their Great Hall. In this room, there is a balcony accessed from the second floor with tiered seating to overlook the proceedings of the meeting. Other than that there are a few decorations around. Books on pedestals, busts, and other artifacts. On the table there are some scrolls and books. A large book titled "History of the Roccs" sits at the head with Reev. Of the Roccs at the meeting, it is just Reev and Sable, accompanied by 4 night stalkers (Who now have the Thug stat block). Reev and Sable try to convince the Alystris to leave Dalonstor and not come back. If things start going poorly or reach a deadlock, he will announce to seemingly no one in the room "You all know what to do", and then he and sable both grab the large book at the head of the table and open it, casting Dimension Door from a Glyph of Warding and disappearing from the room. As this happens, 6 more thugs from around the room suddenly become visible as they fire heavy crossbows at the squishies in the party. A mage on the balcony also becomes visible as he casts a spell. The mage is Siobhan Rocc (Mage stat block, Ice Storm -> Phantasmal Killer, Fly -> Slow). Sylas has a guard stat block, and Balor has the Veteran stat block.

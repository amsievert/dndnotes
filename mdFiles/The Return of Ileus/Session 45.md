Knoglir, the All-Knowing:
Deep beneath a mountain near Mount Smedr, an ancient emerald dragon named Knoglir, the All-Knowing. He hoards knowledge rather than treasure. He has been alive since before the Dissension, staying alive by mostly hiding beneath an Illusion in his mountain lair. However, he was friends with Epius the Archmage of Transmutation. Epius worked in the forge of Mount Smedr for a bit, and Knoglir became friends with him during that time. Knoglir learned a lot from Epius, keeping it all safe in his perfect memory. After the scourge, Knoglir made a deal with Uvira to keep an eye on Epius's forge. In his free time, Knoglir also began collecting knowledge on everything about the Dissension that he had not learned from Epius, this included information on the locations of the Relics of Dissension.

In the modern day, he knows the locations of all of the Relics or at least where the plot hook for each one is. He can be reasoned with by the party to get some of his knowledge.

Knoglir wants to get rid of Ileus because he wants his arcane knowledge and he helps the party find the relics because he wants the knowledge of them.

Knoglir flies the party to his layer inside a nearby dormant volcano. He explains that he watched the party make their way through the workshop with his lava vision. He is slightly suspicious of the party and asks why they know Ileus. He talks about how he has been protecting the workshop since Epius abandoned it millenia ago. He will answer some basic questions from the party. As long as things go well, he will assist the party in brainstorming other ideas about the relics.

He will lead the party to thinking about the Amulet of Greater Health first. He explains that there are two ways to get to it. First, they can travel to Sigil and go through Ecstasy to get to the top layer of Elysium. The second way is to find a way directly to Cielia's realm on the bottom layer of Elysium. He knows little of the Naeran Egress, only that long ago there used to be a gnome who was very dedicated to Cielia. Cielia near present-day Luminespore Hollow.

Summary of Naerkamp:
- Broke off from the population of Himmelknaus pre-dissension
- A priest named Naer received a vision from Cielia warning of the coming dissension. She told him to be skeptical of all mages
- Naer led 700 gnomish farmers deep into the woods to start a new village
- They were protected from the Dissension by a magical swirling storm called the Maelstrom
- Himmelknaus was nuked by one of the gods
- Naerkamp swore to never use magic, and was protected for the rest of the dissension
- At the end, Cielia warned the new High Priestess Minae of her disappearance.

Naerkamp:
Winter is setting across Luminespore Hollow. This is nothing new. However, the winter frost this year is extra brutal. Crops that normally survive have been freezing over and the town is running out of food. The current leader, High Priest Kolan, is assuring the people that it will be ok, but he seems desperate. He keeps saying that he has a plan and that things will get better. Kolan is rumored to be dealing with some of the druids from Luminespore Hollow and some people find it suspicious. They also find it suspicious that Kolan has frost resistant crops planted.

What's actually happening:
Kolan is actually a decent guy who is just really stressed by the whole situation and was trying to reach out to the druids to help with the unexpected cold. In reality, two Bheur Hags have taken residence in the woods nearby and their presence has been corrupting the landscape. Killing them will release the spell.

Spellhaven:
Spellhaven is the center of Arcane Arts in Chandaria. The whole city is made of sculpted white stone and the city is stacked like a layer cake (or Minas Tirith).

Notable places:
Shrine to Ilothar Ilbrie (victor of the battle of Limmedorn's Rift)
Sanctum Arcana
The Neonexus (Gate to Sigil built on the ruins of the Arcane Nexus that was destroyed during the Age of Dominion 1423 PS)

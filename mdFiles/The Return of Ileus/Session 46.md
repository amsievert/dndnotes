Naerkamp:

Winter is setting across Luminespore Hollow. This is nothing new. However, the winter frost this year is extra brutal. Crops that normally survive have been freezing over and the town is running out of food. The current leader, High Priest Kolan, is assuring the people that it will be ok, but he seems desperate. He keeps saying that he has a plan and that things will get better. Kolan is rumored to be dealing with some of the druids from Luminespore Hollow and some people find it suspicious. They also find it suspicious that Kolan has frost resistant crops planted.

What's actually happening:

Kolan is actually a decent guy who is just really stressed by the whole situation and was trying to reach out to the druids to help with the unexpected cold. In reality, two Bheur Hags have taken residence in the woods nearby and their presence has been corrupting the landscape. Killing them will release the spell.

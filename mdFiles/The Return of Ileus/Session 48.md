Day: 26th of Messime, 2519 PS

The party is dropped in front of the Hall of Information in the Clerk's District. They can go inside to get more information or hail a tout named G'lim who charges 1 gp per hour to show them around.

Portals to the Outlands exist in many places. Beatrice Bazlan, the owner of Bottle and Jug in the Hive Ward, knows of a portal to the Outlands. In order to reveal it however, one person needs to beat the arena champion, Akra the Cyclops, in single combat.

In Xaos, there are 2 death slaads that attack the party

If the party ventures further into Limbo, there are 2 mind flayers and 1 mind flayer arcanists that attack.

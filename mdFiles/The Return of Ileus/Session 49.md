Day: 29th of Messime, 2519 PS

At the Planar Energy Cooperative in the Market Ward, there is the portal that connects to the Planar Nexus in Spellhaven. Once the party gets back to the Material Plane, Ileus will start scrying on the party.

Once back in Rodigia, some giants will find the party and tell Bing to come home.

The next artifact the Knoglir tells the party about is the Spear of the Blood Chief. This one he doesn't have many leads on, but knows that it is in the Abyss.

Saraq armor enchanted in 1 week - started on 28th

Current Day: 5th of Planimor, 2519 PS

Saraq armor enchanted in 1 week - started on 28th, done on 5th of Planimor

Once the party gets to Poonhaven, Gerald starts to let loose a little more. He has some drinks and opens up to the party a bit more.

While at Poonhaven, Ileus approaches the party disguised as a sharp looking half-elf in fancy, frilly clothing named Everett Siluvus. If the hammer is visible, he will comment on it. He tries to figure out from the party where they are headed to. His cover story is that he's working with the University to update their accounts of the outer planes, and so he's asking adventurer-looking people for their accounts of the outer planes. At the end of the conversation, he will try to give the party a business card to contact him if they get more information.

If the party takes the business card, Ileus can use it to scry on them without them knowing. A detect magic spell cast on the card reveals divination magic on it.

As long as the party shows Gerald a relatively good time, he will agree to help them to a certain extent. Good persuasion checks can convince him to do more, but the basic help he will give is suggesting to the party that they could fairly easily intercept the guards while they are rotating shifts and disguise themselves as the new guards to get into the Sanctum Arcana. If Gerald is very well persuaded, he will let the party in during the night with his own key and disable the alarm.

In the back room of the Sanctum Arcana top floor are 3 SCMM Guards that guard the entrance to the lower floors of the Sanctum Arcana. The entire guard force of the library rotates at 6pm, 4am, and 12pm.

Inside the reinforced door on the top floor is a floating disk that acts as an elevator for the top half of the floors in the Sanctum.

The Middle Floor - Atrium:
Halfway down in the Sanctum Arcana is a large atrium. In the middle of the large hall is a massive glowing floating orb. A person can make an intelligence check to establish a psychic connection with the orb and it will act like a mainframe, allowing the user to locate any text not in the Forbidden Archive. There are also desks along the walls of this large hall, each one set up below a window with a stained glass portrait of legendary figures from Spellhaven's history. On the far side of the room is a rickety cage elevator that leads to the lower half of the Sanctum. There are 3 SCMM guards on this floor. When they see the party arrive, one of them rushes for a sending stone to call reinforcements that is on one of the desks in the room.

The Bottom Floor - Forbidden Archive
The cage elevator stops in another large hall. This one has almost nothing in it. It is very dim, with glowing murals depicting the falls of the Ancient Archmages. There is a beholder here that is unavoidable, as they see the elevator as soon as it lands on the floor. Behind them is an arched doorway with chained shut reinforced doors. Dark energy seems to spill out from behind the doors.

After the beholder is defeated, its body can be looted for a key to the locked door. Inside is a dark hallway that leads to the Library of the Damned. Upon entering this room, the characters feel oppressed by the energy in the room. Most of the books in here are chained shut, and there are glyphs of warding that activate when a knock spell is cast in the room. This is where the book is that details the story of the Spear of the Blood Chief.

Gerald Backstory:

Gerald Riviera is a 41 year old human man that lives in Spellhaven. He was born to his two parents, Andre and Sepak, in the Living Quarter of the Tertiary District. His parents both worked as scribes for the Assembly, and he was encouraged from a young age to follow in their footsteps. He attended the University of Spellhaven and studied to become an Order of the Scribes wizard. He was pretty average in his academic achievements, but managed to get a job at the Sanctum Arcana because of his parents' positions in the Assembly. He has been working at the Sanctum for 8 years now, and has no ambition of moving up in the ranks. Both of his parents passed away from old age recently and he doesn't have any real friends either. He does have a frog familiar at home named Grub.

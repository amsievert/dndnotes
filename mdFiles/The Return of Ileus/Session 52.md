Abyss Encounters:
After wandering around in the Gaping Maw for a little while, the party hears screams coming from somewhere a little ways off. In a small clearing, a Glabrezu and a Barlgura stand around a metal cage with a gnome man inside. The Glabrezu continuously casts Heat Metal on the cage, and both of the demons laugh to themselves as the gnome writhes in pain. The gnome is actually just the soul of a man who's soul accidentally ended up in the Abyss. His name is Bembenbrank Stumpenbump. He knows of a group of paladins and clerics that came through earlier on some sort of expedition.

There is indeed a group of 3 clerics and 2 paladins taking shelter in a nearby cave. They are all servants of the God Arbitros and they are here tracking down a Marilith that recently attacked a temple in the city of Myrn in Enulon. If the party helps them, the priests could agree to help them break into the Palace of Betrayal.

The Marilith's name is Virezzara, and she runs a small gang of demons called the Mawbrand Legion. The Legion attacked the party of priests when they first arrived in the Gaping Maw, and captured one of their paladins, Sir Jorik. The first mission that the party helps with is to find Sir Jorik.

The clerics take them back to the spot where they were first attacked. There are signs of battle, and a path that leads off the trail and away from the site. Following the trail slightly, it splits in two directions.

"In front of you the trail splits in two directions. To the left, the ground is scarred and uneven. Broken twigs, smoldering leaves, and faint, erratic footprints are scattered throughout. The air smells faintly acrid. To the right, the path appears unnaturally pristine. The ground is smooth and undisturbed in an oddly uniform manner, too perfect to be trusted completely."

Down the right (incorrect) path, the trail leads into an underground tunnel. The ceiling drips and oozes. As they all reach a certain point, the tunnel collapses suddenly behind them. Anyone that fails a DC 20 Dex save takes 3d10 acid damage and is knocked prone. It becomes very apparent that the tunnel walls are made of flesh, and the collapse behind them is more akin to a throat closing. A gurgling sound can be heard from further within the tunnel, and acid quickly starts rising from the ground. The party needs to do 150 damage in 1 turn to open the throat and escape. For each round they fail, they all take 2d10 acid damage and the required damage drops by 50 (maybe 25 depending on how close?).

Down the left path, the smell of brimstone and rot only intensifies. After another 30 minutes of travel, the party comes across the site of another ambush, but it seems that the Legion were the ones being ambushed this time. The ground is scattered with dead quasits, and a few dead weaker demons from the Legion. However, there is also a wounded Legion demon left behind among the bodies. His legs are completely separated and he is slowly dying. He only mutters periodically: "Silent sentinel" "Forgotten by time" "Steeple" "Coil seeks". If pressed sufficiently the demon lies and points the party towards a distant mountain. The mountain is a trap, and it either has the acid trap if unused, or has 2 yuan-ti anathemas otherwise.

Further down the correct path, it looks as though the party was attacked again, but this time by another organized band of demons. A tiefling woman is picking through the corpses. She is friendly. Her brother was a prisoner held by the attacking gang. He was killed during the battle by the corrupted Sir Jorik. She asks the party to kill him if they find him, and she sends them in the direction that they went.

Halfway through the interrogation, a blood rain starts, and the party must protect the tiefling, or she will die from the acidic rain.

At the end of the path, is a small camp where Sir Jorik and 2 cambions and 2 merregons are resting, healing from their wounds. The clerics want to spare and redeem Sir Jorik, but the tiefling really wants him dead.

If spared, Sir Jorik knows exactly where Virezzara is, otherwise he blurts out something about an Obsidian Tower before he dies.

Virezzara is at the nearest abandoned Obsidian Palace. She is in the basement setting up another ritual with her Bulezau minion (minion only there if paladins still alive).

Now that Virezzara is dead, the priests will help the party break into the the Palace of Betrayal. The priests repay the party by telling them about the Scar of the Penitents. There is a small fissure in the rock that makes up the base of the palace. It was allegedly made by a prisoner attempting to break out of the palace who was betrayed and killed as soon as he escaped. Voices echo inside the passage that remind the party members of their betrayals and regrets.
- Astarius: The voices remind him about his sister and how he betrayed her by leaving, only to come back and get her killed.
- Utu: The voices remind him about how his whole village was destroyed by wizards yet he works alongside wizards and didn't burn down the Sanctum, betraying his home.
- Holfog: The voices remind him about how he is betraying his family by doing evil things without even getting money from it.
- Helia: The voices remind her about how she betrayed her whole village by learning magic and betrayed Pylantos by not being there when he died
- Saraq: The voices remind him about how he abandoned his tribe and his mother, leaving her to get usurped by the other families.

Once inside the palace, the party is in the dungeon. Here, there is a wraith that offers to guide them through the palace, at a certain point, the wraith betrays them and 2 more wraiths ambush the party.

Outside Berzir's throne room is an indoor garden with gross-looking, overgrown thorn plants. An Erinyes guards the gates to the throne room. She asks the party who they are and what they are here for. If any lies are told in the presence of the plants, the start growing out towards the source of the lie. The Erinyes' name is Tholak, and she is here because she is also a pact breaker from the Scourge. There is a small chance that she can be persuaded to betray Berzir, in which case he has a Goristro underling that the Erinyes takes out by tackling it out the giant stained-glass window behind Berzir's throne. If pissed off, she will fight the party however.

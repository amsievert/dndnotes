Current Day: 7th of Planimor

Abyss Encounters:
If spared, Sir Jorik knows exactly where Virezzara is, otherwise he blurts out something about an Obsidian Tower before he dies.

Virezzara is at the nearest abandoned Obsidian Palace. She is in the basement setting up another ritual with her Bulezau minion (minion only there if paladins still alive).

Now that Virezzara is dead, the priests will help the party break into the the Palace of Betrayal. The priests repay the party by telling them about the Scar of the Penitents. There is a small fissure in the rock that makes up the base of the palace. It was allegedly made by a prisoner attempting to break out of the palace who was betrayed and killed as soon as he escaped. Voices echo inside the passage that remind the party members of their betrayals and regrets.
- Astarius: The voices remind him about his sister and how he betrayed her by leaving, only to come back and get her killed.
- Utu: The voices remind him about how his whole village was destroyed by wizards yet he works alongside wizards and didn't burn down the Sanctum, betraying his home.
- Holfog: The voices remind him about how he is betrayed the Roccs that he used to work with and killed a lot of innocent people in the process.
- Helia: The voices remind her about how she betrayed her whole village by learning magic and betrayed Pylantos by not being there when he died
- Saraq: The voices remind him about how he abandoned his tribe and his mother, leaving her to get usurped by the other families.

Once inside the palace, the party is in the dungeon. Disembodied wails echo through the dark empty corridors. Some of the voices beg for help. All of the souls trapped here are souls of creatures that were killed by Berzir.

Throughout the palace, a really good investigation or perception check reveals the same water droplets leading towards the throne room, the same droplets as in Spellhaven.

Outside Berzir's throne room is a courtyard full of gross, sharp thorns. An erinyes named Thalok guards the doors to the throne room. She asks the party what their business is, immediatley noticing that the party is not souls. Any lies told in the presence of the thorns causes them to grow towards the source. The erinyes can be deceived.

The doors to the throne room are 30 foot tall brass doors. Inside the throne room, Berzir sits on a golden throne with skulls adorning the edges.

After one round of combat, whoever is closest to the doors hears Power Word Kill cast outside, and a thud. Shortly after, Everrett Siluvis (actually Ileus simulacrum) bursts in through the door, visibly sweating. Combat stops and there is roleplay again. If combat resumes, it is a three way combat now, since Ileus also wants the spear.

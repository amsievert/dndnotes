Current Day: 7th of Planimor, 2519 PS

After one round of combat, whoever is closest to the doors hears Power Word Kill cast outside, and a thud. Shortly after, Everrett Siluvis (actually Ileus simulacrum) bursts in through the door, visibly sweating. Combat stops and there is roleplay again. If combat resumes, it is a three way combat now, since Ileus also wants the spear.

As Everrett enters the throne room and the door closes behind him too, he stops for a moment assessing his surroundings. He is panting and visibly sweating. A moment passes before the illusion drops and the true Ileus simulacrum can be seen. However, the Abyssal heat seems to be almost melting him, and parts of his face sag and other parts of his body bend at slightly unnatural angles.  He looks between the party and Berzir with the spear. Roleplay open here.

If the party is fully killed, after some narration about their souls finally drifting to peace, they are suddenly ripped back to reality. The real Ileus stands before all of them, having just revived them. He has taken them to his Demiplanar lair. He wants to know how they are able to find the relics so easily. He questions them further about their journey to find each of the relics and asks if they know anything about any other relics. Ileus knows what the other relics are, but he doesn't reveal this to the party. Ultimately, he provides the party with a choice, either reveal their source of information (Knoglir) and help Ileus kill Knoglir, or die again and stay dead. If the former is chosen, he leaves them alone for a few days to recover from being resurrected. He leaves them alone in a locked section of his tower. The tower itself floats magically and has many branching corridors and spires that almost resemble a minecraft end city. These few days give the party a small opportunity to escape.

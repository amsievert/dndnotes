Current Day: 21th of Planimor, 2519 PS

At the Alystri Manor, the party is greeted at the gates by Master Toth. If Astarius's death is mentioned, he seems very confused. He tells of how just yesterday, Astarius's body washed up on the beach near the port and was found by some local fishermen.

The changed Astarius lies in the all too familiar infirmary. He is unconscious but looks noticeably different. His whole demeanor seems very disheveled. The biggest difference: his shield arm seems very atrophied. It is much thinner than the other arm. The skin on this arm is marred by text scrawled down its length that seems to be carved into the flesh. The script is Dwarvish but the language itself is Primordial.

Back at Knoglir's lair, he shares that weirdly, about half the Larenthian army packed up and is retreating to the north. Their seems to have been some sort of disagreement among the leadership or something. He also shares that if the group has any remains from Jib, he could potentially reincarnate him now that his soul is freed.

The next order of business is tracking down the next relic. Knoglir acknowledges that there are 2 left that he knows of. The next one that he thinks they should find is the Robe of the Dead, which once belonged to Invexeor, the Archmage of necromancy. Knoglir acknowledges that this quest is very similar to the Amulet of Health. The party can either trek through the glooms of Hades, or they can look for a portal to Invexeor's realm on the mortal plane. He doesn't know for sure where the portal is, but he has heard sailor talk of a mysterious death island in the Wildlands. Knoglir offers to send the party to Kraken Cove so that they can learn more.

Kraken Cove:
Talking to NPCs in the city, they come across an old retired pirate by the name of Old Hal Whitlow. He recounts many stories. One includes tales of "silver-eyed ghosts" off the coast of a mysterious shrouded island. According to him, the waters around the coast are incredibly acidic, and should not be touched at all.

Harbormaster:
Harbormaster Marin has an office above the docks that holds all the shipping manifests. The party can find a ledger that notes of one ship that made it to the island and successfully returned. That ship is named the Triple Clipper captained by Captain Selene Stormrunner.

If encountered, Marin asks for a favor first for information. He asks if the party can retrieve a small chest of harmonium shards from a sunken ship just down the coast. The ship is guarded by 3 sahuagin barons and 3 sahuagin priestesses. In the ship is a wrecked journal that only has one phrase legible in it: "â€¦Name none dare utter"

Triple Clipper:
Captain Stormrunner is very skeptical about the party and their intentions. She sailed to the island because she was tasked with retrieving goods from a ship that ran aground in the islands shallows.

It is a 2 weeks journey to the island. Near the island, the party is beset upon by a ghost ship, crewed by various undead, the captain of whom is a Banshee.

The Death Island:
There is an ancient ward that prevents teleportation to or from the island.

Astarius's Pact is this:
Astarius must kill Ileus. That is his ultimate goal. Any action taken directly against this goal can result in punishment and in some cases revocation of the granted resurrection.

The agreement can only be voided if Ileus is killed. No other conditions will end the pact, not even death of either agreeing party. Should Astarius die again before the mission is completed, his soul will join Amphinor's domain as a servant forever.

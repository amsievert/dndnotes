Current Day: 7th Friga, 2519 PS

Harbormaster:
Harbormaster Marin has an office above the docks that holds all the shipping manifests. The party can find a ledger that notes of one ship that made it to the island and successfully returned. That ship is named the Triple Clipper captained by Captain Selene Stormrunner.

If encountered, Marin asks for a favor first for information. He asks if the party can retrieve a small chest of harmonium shards from a sunken ship just down the coast. The ship is guarded by 3 sahuagin barons and 3 sahuagin priestesses. In the ship is a wrecked journal that only has one phrase legible in it: "â€¦Name none dare utter"

Triple Clipper:
Captain Stormrunner is very skeptical about the party and their intentions. She sailed to the island because she was tasked with retrieving goods from a ship that ran aground in the islands shallows.

It is a 2 weeks journey to the island. Near the island, the party is beset upon by a ghost ship, crewed by various undead, the captain of whom is a Banshee.

The Death Island:
There is an ancient ward that prevents teleportation to or from the island

The waters surrounding the island are a putrid black color that seems to almost stick to the hull of the ship as it cuts through. If any creature touches the water, they take 1d10 necrotic and 1d10 acid damage for every turn spent in the water.

On the actual island, the air is choked in a thick fog that stinks of death. All of the trees appear to be dead. Captain Stormrunner takes the ship to the same spot that they docked at last time. She bids the party farewell and offers them a rowboat to take them ashore. As soon as they set foot on the island, the are immediately hit by a wave of sadness and apathy.

The first landmark that the party would encounter by walking inland would be the bleeding tree.

Island Overall Arc:
The portal is in a temple that Invexeor at one point used to study necromancy along with a group of Mortessa clerics. Despite their connection to Mortessa, these clerics were sympathetic to the Anteitic cause and performed rituals to keep their divine magic. The portal to Hades has since been closed by the remaining members of the Mortessa cult to protect Invexeor. The portal was actually created accidentally by Invexeor, who was searching for a way to achieve invulnerability without becoming a Lich. He took his experiments too far, and ended up sacrificing his first apprentice, Dravennon, on an altar to finally unlock the secret of true immortality. This sacrifice unleashed a tremendous amount of raw magical power that opened a portal to Hades. Due to the nature of Dravennon's death, his name was stricken from every record, and Invexeor is the only one that still remembers it. Everyone else remembers his second apprentice Lirin as his only apprentice. The only way to reopen the portal is to pour a drop of blood from Dravennon's sacrifice (which can be obtained from the altar in the north), and to speak Dravennon's name, since it has become forgotten by time.

The cult of Mortessa that worked with Invexeor is still on the island, but they are all undead by this point. They wear bronze masks and wear dark gray/green robes with bronze gilding around the edges. The masks give them the power to see through the islands mists.

Island Landmarks:
On the northern shore of the island is the altar of Dravennon's sacrifice. Touching the altar at any point shows the toucher shards of Dravennon's memory of the sacrifice (Knife flash, hot pain, dedication). To unlock the full memory, one must lay on the altar like one ready to be sacrificed. At this point, if they draw blood, their own blood becomes the blood of Dravennon.

At the center of the island is a rocky hill that has some sort of colossal skull set in the cliff face. The skull is that of an ancient giant, one of the early descendants of Annam, whose skull has since grown to its massive size. The eyes of the skull are entrances to the lair of the Mortessa Cult.

The temple with the portal is between the Cult Lair and the altar. It was once a grand place of research but is since decrepit and corrupted by the power of Hades.

Just inland from the southern beach is the bleeding tree. This tree's birch-like bark constantly bleeds blood red sap. Interacting with tree, the interactor feels the tree's desire for a willing sacrifice at its roots. If this is accomplished, the tree alerts the party of the cultists that are constantly watching through the fog.

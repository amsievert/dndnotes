Current Day: 9th Friga, 2519 PS

Hades:
The party is spit out on a black sand beach on the edge of a pale, sluggish river. Undead ferrymen navigate gondolas up and down the river. The sky is overcast with a pale, sickly green. The air is at a weird point of being cold and warm at the same time. It feels like having a fever.

Off on the horizon they see the walls of a city. In between their current location and the city are groves of dry, dying poplar trees. Stalking amongst the trees is an Yagnoloth and a Mezzoloth that try to kill the party to offer their bodies to Corpus and gain entry for themselves.

Upon reaching the city (Corpus), the party is able to take in the sight that it is. The city is entirely made up of bodies, forming one organism. At the Shady Grove tavern, an Arcanaloth named Nel offers to help the party search for clues of Invexeor in the city. In reality, Nel wants to gain the party's trust to imprison them in his tome.

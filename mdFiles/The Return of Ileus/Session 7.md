Day: 27th of Florum, 2519 PS

Town criers throughout the city are calling out about different things. One proclaims about how the region's supply of timber and metal has declined rapidly in the past few days and the price has increased drastically. Another calls out saying that Sir William Hudd is calling for an ousting of Lord Pixton and is offering to take the role of Lord for himself on a platform of heavily increasing security for the city.

If the party chooses to follow up with Adwear, they will come across quite a concerning scene at the Institute. There are guards surrounding the main office building and it is completely locked down. The library is also closed down. The guards will not let anyone through.

The information that can be gotten is, 2 guards on shift last night were murdered by an unknown attacker. The library was broken into and books and maps were stolen from the restricted section. Adwear's office was also broken into and ransacked. Adwear himself is nowhere to be found but there are signs of a struggle and blood in the office. The party can try to sneak up to the office if they want.

Goblin Camp:
20 Goblins
1 Goblin Boss
5 Hobgoblins
2 Bugbears
2 Ogre Bolt Launchers

Forest Encounters:
The party hears mysterious whispering coming from around them as they travel through the forest. This should probably happen on the path closer to the camp. Upon further investigation, the whispers seem to be coming from two specific trees. They turn out to be Treants who are talking shit about the party. They could be convinced to help direct the party towards the goblin camp.

Just off the path, the party spots a small gravesite. The gravesite consists of a small stone with Helvalic Runes inscribed into it (The runes describe the life of a warrior who fought against invaders from the east. The warrior's name was Rilvos. In front of the headstone is a metal helmet covered in moss and dirt. A DC 13 investigation check reveals a Periapt of Health buried beneath the helmet.

Just as the party enters the forest, they hear a large number of footfalls coming from in front of them. A large army of bugbears, ogres, and hobgoblins march past, heading in the direction of the north side of the Holfirth clearing.

If the party chooses to go fight the small goblin camp with their newly acquired soldiers, they can do so. In the camp is the goblin boss who they encountered when they first left Dire Wolf Grotto. There are also about 20 goblins, and 5 hobgoblins. If the party goes at night, there will be a Goblin Shaman there delivering a message from Kardag. The message is detailing the plan going forward. Kardag requests that all warbands meet on the edge of the clearing north of Holfirth to prepare for a siege on the city. The location of the armor has been discovered and Kardag is leading a force to get it at the current moment. The letter also talks about how their "Man on the Inside" will get them what they need once they have the armor so that the siege can go smoothly.
